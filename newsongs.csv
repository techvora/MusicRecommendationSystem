I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
  
You are the sun,  
  
You are my light,  
  
And you're the last thing on my mind, before I go to sleep at night,  
  
You're always round,  
  
When I'm in need,  
  
When troubles on my mind,  
  
You put my soul at ease,  
  
  
There is no one in this world,  
  
Who can love me like you do,  
  
That is the reason that I,  
  
want to spend forever with you,  
  
  
I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
  
We've had a fun,  
  
We've made mistakes,  
  
But who'd have guessed along that road, we'd learn to give and take,  
  
It's so much more than I could have dreamed,  
  
Cause you've make loving you, so easy for me,  
  
  
There is no one in this world,  
  
Who can love me like you do,  
  
That is the reason that I,  
  
want to spend forever with you,  
  
  
I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
  
And girl I pray you leave me, never,  
  
  
Cause this is the world, where lovers often go astray,  
  
But if we learn each other, we won't go that way,  
  
So put your doubts aside,  
  
Do what it takes to make it right,  
  
I love you, forever, no-one can tear us apart,  
  
  
I'll be loving you forever, ( forever)  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart, ( took my heart girl)  
  
And tore it apart, ( you tore it apart now)  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
And I'll be loving you forever, (forever)  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart, ( you took my heart girl)  
  
And tore it apart, ( you tore it apart now)  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever.

Sublime,Romeo,/s/sublime/romeo_20133128.html,"  
  
  
  
  
I have a secret place inside my mind  
  
where I keep hidden inspiration you will find.  
  
And when my petty anger goes to my head  
  
you'll find I'm better off dead.  
  
Oh and I don't hold the key  
  
to find out what is killing me its  
  
been so long but somehow i just still care  
  
I am a Romeo am a Romeo with no place to go  
  
  
Sometimes I think you hate me hang up the phone  
  
but take a closer look this hate I feel is my own.  
  
So many times I've loved you, more than myself,  
  
it's time to take that love and put it on the shelf.  
  
Oh, and when I hold you tight,  
  
it makes me want to scream and fight.  
  
Love turned to hate,  
  
some how it's just, how it's just,  
  
how it's just to late.  
  
  
I am a Romeo, am a Romeo with no place to go  
  
  
Rock the reggae music, 'cause it sounds so fine, right!  
  
When I hold you tight, in my arms you are mine,  
  
but in the morning when I wake up and I still feel the same,  
  
I know something goin on and I know who's to blame.  
  
Everytime I tell you I'm the real Romeo,  
  
it fills my soul and heart with anger, pain, and sorrow.  
  
'cause' somthings going on and I think you should know,  
  
so listen to my rhyme, 'cause this is how it goes:  
  
  
In a tight mini short in a short mini skirt,  
  
it feels so wrong and it feels so right.  
  
the more I think about it you're a pain in the ass,  
  
I told you many times, this time it's gonna last.  
  
Want the kind of woman who can make me feel right,  
  
not sloppy drunk sex on a Saturday night. 'cause,  
  
  
I am a Romeo, am a Romeo with no place to go  
  
  
Pull up your honey if you gotta one see,  
  
because your down with the style, 'cause your down with me. oh,  
  
rig the selector when your on the mixer,  
  
along with Peter Mitchell upon the echo chamber. Two, one,  
  
no they must see but no, they can't test me.  
  
Two, three of them come and say you can't test me.  
  
Because me rock the reggae music in a different stylee.  
  
Me rock the kinda reggae music right on time, because your down with the  
  
band that they call Sublime, right?  
  
  
Don't take it too slow, don't take me wrong,  
  
me know which way to go, me, me, me, me alright,  
  
me rock the reggae music day and all night.  
  
  
Makes you want to explode,  
  
makes me want to explode,  
  
makes me want to explode,  
  
makes you want to explode,  
  
sometimes it makes you want to explode.

You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.  
  
Then they flap their wings at the last second.  
  
I can see their dead weight  
  
Just dropping like stones  
  
For small loaves of bread  
  
Past my window all the time.  
  
But unless I get up  
  
Walk across the room  
  
And peer down below  
  
I don't see their last second curves  
  
Toward a horizontal flight.  
  
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.  
  
Now due to a construct in my mind  
  
That makes their falling and their flight  
  
Symbolic of my entire existence,  
  
It becomes important for me

Their last second curves toward flight.  
  
It's almost as if my life will fall  
  
Unless I see their ascent.

we stand we fall  
  
we struggle up

but our lives are strong together  
  
on a common thread  
  
and this circle (circle)  
  
just goes on and on (on and on)  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we've gone  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
connecting our humanity  
  
joining me to you and you to me  
  
around and round and round and round we go  
  
around and round and round we go  
  
love and learn and change and grow  
  
round and round and round we go  
  
and this circle  
  
touches everyone  
  
as it crosses every boundary  
  
underneath the sun  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we're gone  
  
yes this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
someday we will come to see  
  
I'm joined to you and you to me

Hello, boys and girls.  
  
Welcome, to Wyclef Words of Wisdom.  
  
Have you ever been sitting in your  
  
house at two o'clock in the morning  
  
and you get a mysterious phone  
  
call from a girl that you don't know? (A female begins talking sexy)  
  
Now, hold on, think with your mind  
  
and not with your pistol.  
  
Cause if you invite her over  
  
this is what might happen:  
  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape!

You ran away with your conscience dear  
  
There was a red flag waving in my ear saying  
  
""Stay away, you've got something to fear""  
  
Well why did I not choose to hear?  
  
Well I am through with suffering  
  
Gonna make better choices I don't need no wedding ring  
  
I can sing, I can dance  
  
But I can't make thus feeling cease  
  
Cause deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
We all got our cross to bear  
  
Our Star of David, our dreadlocked hair  
  
And oh yeah baby, I still care  
  
And if you need some help  
  
You know I'll always be there  
  
  
Well it's been a strange year  
  
You've been a very bad dog  
  
As my fire went out  
  
You'd put on another log  
  
But it was worth never having any peace  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
  
Some nights I thought I'd cry forever  
  
I'd wish him away and then I'd turn into a beggar  
  
But it was worth always scraping my knees  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease  
  
  
I wear my heart like a wrinkle on my sleeve  
  
  
And I've got the aching love that only you can relieve  
  
But I'm not afraid to go down with a sinking friend  
  
I'm gonna live out my dreams even if they kill me in the end

Now let me introduce whose first  
The nigga that's been down  
with the set since birth  
Whatever it was worth  
I checked in on the norm  
Since a juvenile callin'  
Shots in the dorm  
Moms said you better get right  
Or shake the spot  
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone  
Like pop  
Stashin' the rocks by the gats  
With the Gs  
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!  
I don't fight the feelin'  
Gotta hustle with a passion  
Comin' cross state to put you down  
With some action  
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets  
Remininsin' younger days  
Over gangsa ass beats  
And I,  
Hit the weed  
Til myeye balls bleed  
While my life is corrupted  
By lust and greed  
Serve you anything from cocaine  
Up to speed  
I came with the drank  
So here's five on the weed  
  
Xzibit:  
See kids don't belong  
Up in grown folks business  
The Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness  
Sickness bear witness  
Like tequlla without a chaser  
It burns going down  
Niggas guaranteed to drown  
Legendary sound  
From the west coast underground  
The mighty King Tee  
And Mr. X to the Z, see  
Never underestimate the power  
Of the X man  
Dismantle your plans  
Or just catch you with a back hand  
Xzbit bring it to you live  
With the know how  
Cool in a gang  
And ain't about to change  
My lifestyle  
Catchin' bodies in this uphill battle  
But Xzibit unravel  
Have smoke will travel  
I bust Teflon rhymes  
Into the crowd, bitch  
You anin't Steve Rif  
So stop trying to get Loud  
You need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision  
Xzibit still winnin'  
Unanimous decisions  
  
King Tee:  
It's going down  
Once again everybody lay down  
Run your money and the jewels  
To the front without a sound  
The infamous supreme King Tee  
Glad to meet ya  
Derranged in the mothafuckin' brain  
Through ya speaka and hey  
I walk around the hood lookin' looped  
Strapped like a mothafuckin'  
Desert strom troop  
Niggas be like ""King Tila  
How you get that Benz?""  
By sending birds to Oklahoma City  
To my friends  
I slang my gangsta funk  
Through the night  
Sometimes I fight  
Like I'm the ghost of Eric Wright  
Compton is where I dwell  
It's like hell  
Slangin' the shit that got the smokers  
In a spell  
And all my homies live lives  
Like crooks  
Rich and infamous  
Hoes want to look but get shook  
Cause we don't trust you hoes  
You'll have a nigga fucked up  
With a bullet through his clothes  
Positively nothings positive  
Negativity positively how we live  
Positively nothings positive  
Negativity positively how we live

Ladies and gentlemen  
Undivided attention  
Xzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson  
It's the...  
Most dangerous things next to grizzles  
Unsolved mysteries  
Xzibit hit you penetentary style  
Quick sharp and straight to the neck  
I'm heavy on your chest  
I'm all up in your life  
Like stress  
The coast that resides to your left  
Whre niggas perpitrate  
And catch a fate worse than death  
And like Cyanide I'm hard to detect  
Got more desighns and stragiht lines  
Than an architect

Not afraid to paint my sky with  
Some who say I've lost my mind  
Brother try and hope to find  
You were always so far away  
I know that pain so don't you run away  
Like you used to do  
Roses in a vase of white  
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves  
That fall because my hand is pulling them hard as I can  
You were always so far away  
I know that pain and I won't run away  
Like I used to do  
Pictures in a box at home  
Yellowing and green with mold  
So I can barely see your face  
Wonder how that color taste  
You were always so far away  
I know the way so don't you run away  
Like you used to do

I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didn't believe the hype

Intro:  
  
Listen you fuckers, you screwheads  
Here's a man who won't take it anymore  
A man who stood up against  
The skunk, the kunts, the dogs, the fill, the shit  
Here is some one who stood up  
Here is...  
  
Yeah! this is it for anybody usin bodies  
presents, Xzibit movin at the speed of life  
Yeah! check it  
  
Verse One:  
  
It took a long time comin but we waited  
Xzibit went from underated  
To now most antcipaded  
never would of thought that I would rock your set  
And get love and respect without no special effects  
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need  
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed  
thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed  
Tryin to glority greed  
Livin life at ridiculuos speed-indeed!  
The main goal to achieve, is to succeed  
Have it laid out for your seed  
But the world gets colder every day by day  
Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A.  
Trying to find piece of mind  
is like trying to find a gold mine  
it just won't happen  
no time for relaxin  
Real soldiers of fortune  
the front line of the action  
So never show a nigga what you packin'  
""You know what i'm sayin'?""  
It's too much weight to be juggling  
who do you picture when you think about struggling  
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin  
Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah!  
yes movin...  
At the speed of life  
  
Verse Two:  
  
And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine  
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes  
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind  
and when I die!  
Niggas still recite these lines  
to rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns  
Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down  
the underground! to upper echelon and beyond  
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond  
Nigga want to trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch  
mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon  
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone  
It's the law of the land  
a straight modern day babylon!

Ah! Bring it live, yeah!  
  
Verse Three:  
  
Xzibit lookin at the earth through wide angles  
I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels  
Where small situations turn to altercation  
with a heavy ass price  
'cause niggas don't fight no more!  
before hip hop was all about drama  
anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona  
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma  
Just me and my bottle  
we shall lead not follow  
Emcees be full of shit  
but they style be hollow  
it seems you've bitin off more  
than you can possibly swallow  
just a day in the life of a man named X  
only blunt and latex for the oppisite sex  
you see niggas comin through to smoke and pay respect  
ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything  
whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion  
I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion  
but in the mean while if worse comes to worst  
bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first  
Yeah! we got it locked down tight  
Xzibit bring truth to the light  
shit is movin at the speed of life  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...  
At the speed of life

My mom bought you when I was just 13,  
the brightest red sweatshirt I ever seen.  
She got an extra large so I wouldn't grow out,  
""That's too big for you!"" the other kids would shout.  
But we stuck together, we didn't quit,  
and now the children say, ""What a perfect fit.""  
  
I love you sweeeeatshirt  
red hooded  
sweeeeatshirt  
dip dip dip  
sweeeeatshirt

I like to rest my hands in your kangaroo pouch,  
it makes them feel comfy like a big soft couch.  
And I don't care if the weather's no good,  
I say ""See you later rain"" as I pull up my hood.  
Remember that long bus trip when I needed a nap?,  
I used you as a pillow on that Spanish lady's lap.  
I love you sweeeeatshirt red hooded  
sweeeeatshirt  
dip dip dip sweeeeatshirt  
shama lama ding dong

Oh what is it about you that makes me so jolly?,  
Is it your fifty cotton or your fifty poly?  
  
I don't knoooooooww  
ohh ohh hoo hoo hoo.  
  
Oh red hooded sweatshirt we been through a lot together like that time I
played in that shirts and skins basketball game and I  
had to take you off and throw you in the corner of the gym. I was midway
through the game and then I saw you looking at me.  
You were staring as if to say ""Adam, you suck at basketball, you dribble like
a damn woman."" I was so mad I challenged you  
to a game of one on one and you know sweatshirt, even though I beat you 11 to
9, deep in my soul I know you missed those  
lay-ups on purpose. You let me win and that why I'll forever feel this way.

Tired of infantile claims

Pick at me slow, pain fiend  
Suck me through barbed screen  
Anger becomes our queen  
Tongue whipping forked black  
How long until you crack  
Surprised and set back  
Lackeys' loose talk for fact

Tired of the shadowin'  
Slide me to the side again (2x)  
Slapped in the face again

So crazy feel the hate  
Yeah, I've got years to wait  
I know it's not too late  
Lending clean hands of fate  
Rise from the dirt I'm in  
Hide in another's skin  
Stick black dress doll with pin  
Your mouth takes on my grin  
So crazy (3x)

I stay on the block, and risk my life  
Day in and day out until a nigga sold out  
You niggaz playin', I show you what that street shit 'bout  
Hit you right up with them thangs, and come back with the chains  
Might cook it in the stove, might cook it in the microwave  
Either way it's gonna sell, still weigh it on the scale  
You rappin'-ass niggaz ain't never sold no yams

I'm gnawing on the knowledge  
  
That I have been burnt  
  
And I'm learning things that I  
  
Should've already learnt  
  
Everyone I ever knew  
  
Was so kind and coy  
  
I was with a girl  
  
But it felt like I was with a boy  
  
I can't even remember  
  
If we were lovers  
  
Or if I just wanted to  
  
But I held her in my arms  
  
I held her in my arms  
  
I held her in my arms  
  
But it wasn't you  
  
I will not kill  
  
The one thing that I love  
  
In this world of wreckage

Help me Lord  
  
Help me understand  
  
What it means to be a boy

I'm waiting for my visit  
They'll fill this room with flowers an' all  
They'll put on their biggest smile  
But only for a while  
  
If only I could help it  
If only mercy'd be on my side  
I wouldn't have to die  
And my family wouldn't cry  
  
But the pain is getting far to strong  
And the medicine won't hold for long  
It's getting closer  
So I'm waiting for someone to come  
To come and take my soul where it belongs  
But no one's coming no one  
  
So I'm calling heaven now  
I'm calling heaven now  
Calling heaven's hand  
So heaven help  
  
I try to find the aswer  
I try to find a reason why I  
I'm leaving them all behind  
But there's something I will find  
  
The blood's still running through my heart  
But my hairs are slowly falling apart  
And I just can't take it  
So I'm waiting for someone to come  
To come and take my soul where it belongs  
But no one's coming, no one  
  
So I'm calling heaven now  
I'm calling heaven now  
Calling heaven's hand  
So heaven help  
Yes I'm calling heaven...  
  
I see it in their faces  
They know I'll be leaving tonight  
But somewhere down the line  
I'm sure we'll meet again  
Somewhere down the line  
I'm sure we'll meet again

In a town far from the city  
Was a girl just a child  
She grew up to a beautiful dream  
  
And she walked like a queen  
When she walked down the street  
All the men turned around  
To see her high heels  
  
She walked like a queen  
When she walked down the street  
All the men turn around  
To see her go on  
  
Jealousy wasn't a stranger  
Everywhere she would be  
So she cried for someone to help  
  
I want to know is anybody gonna help me when I'm down  
I want to know will anybody really help me when I'm down  
  
She walks like a queen  
When she walks down the street  
All the men turn around  
To see her high heels  
She walks like a queen  
When she walks down that street  
All the men turn around  
To see her high heels  
  
I want to know is ...  
I want to know will ...

And at last a fire was burning  
As a man held her hand

In this grey world where nobody sings  
I saw the face of a human doll  
Her eyes were glass and her hair was gold  
From her sweet soft lips  
You could hear that song go  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
In a place where hell is around the corner  
I touched her hand it was baby sweet  
She kissed me there  
I could feel the song going down my throat  
She was singing to me  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
My daddy said if you want to live  
You better not touch this is not a toy  
The truth is boy I'm a bloody fool  
I left the one I loved behind, singing  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...

Where the black swan loves the one I lost  
My generation sings with the radio on  
The melody of the human doll

Rather than you, she said  
I prefer solitude  
Rather the company  
I prefer cigarrettes  
Even Los Angeles  
Suffers occasionally  
Do you have somewhere to stay?  
But no more love songs  
Not for me  
I gave er whisky  
And she gave me everything  
There was a boy, she said  
Beautiful, eloquent  
He went to Spain  
And where he went, she went  
No Joan of Arc  
She was broken discarded  
And that was a long time ago  
Still, no more love songs  
No more love songs  
Stil, you might as well live  
I'll drink to harmony  
Peace and disarmament  
I'll dance the victory waltz  
But no more love songs  
No more

The monkey chased the weasel,  
The monkey thought 'twas all in fun  
Pop! Goes the weasel.  
  
A penny for a spool of thread  
A penny for a needle,  
That's the way the money goes,

A half a pound of treacle.

Hello, it's me  
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet  
To go over everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  
  
Hello, can you hear me  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
There's such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
  
Hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried  
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry  
I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened  
  
It's no secret that the both of us  
Are running out of time  
  
So hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried  
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Anymore  
  
Hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried  
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
Up and down the London road,  
In and out of the Eagle,  
That's the way the money goes,  
Pop! Goes the weasel.  
  
I've no time to plead and pine,  
I've no time to wheedle,  
Kiss me quick and then I'm gone  
Pop! Goes the weasel.

lies lies lies

he'll tell you all about that

by the sea of Galilee

with something funny I start to see

lies lies lies  
  
I never had this problem  
  
with nobody in the government  
  
I guess I always figured  
  
they never mean what they meant  
  
and GOD help us all

with the skies in our eyes

(Chorus)  
Fuck! Damnit! Another Halloween  
People on Military know what this means  
Houses on fire, they're blowin up cars  
Creatures in the streets, and razor blades and candy bars  
I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block  
Spit in my face and gave my a rock  
I tried to give it back and said ""I'll take nothing instead""  
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head  
Walked to the next house directly next door  
There I saw an old lady dead on the floor  
I said ""Excuse me miss, but do you have a treat?""  
She lifted her leg and scrapped flakes off her dead feet  
I ran to the next house happy and giddy  
And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty  
I said, ""Trick-or-treat."" she sad ""Treat-or-trick.""  
And squeezed on her titty until it.....fuck it, that's too sick  
Next house up was sittin back in the woods  
I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods  
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back  
And then I heard ""COME ON IN"" and yo I'm like FUCK DAT  
This house belongs to Mrs. Cherry Spoon  
She said, Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon  
I quickly grew a stiffy, but kept my eyes shut  
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts  
I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst  
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst  
I rang the door bell and said Is anybody home  
Of course little biy have a sugar coated kidney stone  
I walked throught the field, and to the next crib  
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib  
I said ""How bout some candy."" she said How bout instead,  
A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread  
My bag's gettin heavy so I rest on the curb  
And riding on his bike her comes little Larry Shurb  
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat  
I punched him in the neck, and power bombed him in the street  
Now my bag of candy has doubled in size  
Up to the next house for my scary prize  
I'm like trick-or-treat, trick treat tricky dick  
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit  
Rock through his window and ran across the street  
To the Dayton Mansion I'm in for a treat  
I dinged on the dong, and here comes the butler  
A big gumpy tall ass lurch lookin motherfucker  
I said Hello Mr. is there somethin for my sack  
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back  
It's taking him an hour, my bag is open ready  
But then he finally dropped it in my sack, a fucking penny  
The next house is abandonded so forget it  
But wait a minute, I think somebody's livin in it  
I ran up to the door ""Trick-or-treat, you can't hide""  
It was a crackhead, he crawled in my bag and died  
The next house is mine the last on the block  
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her glock  
I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady  
And we yelled ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE!"" to the whole city

her name Tequila, we met in October  
I hit her all the time, I can't sleep on your sofa  
one hit and it's over, the girl's addictive

don't give me no problems when I'm with her  
nice brown tone, she got me slither

and all the other hoes feelin' low, lookin' stupid  
thought we was, we was two of a kinda cuttin'a rug  
in back of the club, two of the most dangerous thugs  
soakin' up your brain, driving you insane  
and leaving you to lay on your back constrained  
with no complaint, she's off the chain like no other

and damn near foolish and one more gonna have me coo-coo  
and kicked up 'til I'm tore up now what's the hold up  
it's on now we back up on it, just as we post up  
slither at the bar damn drunk to the world  
burnin' down the club callin' on your boy Earl

I'm a North Memphis Survivor...Survivor  
I'm a North memphis Survivor...I'm a young nigga, money and power  
[Yo Gotti]  
I was a young nigga thugging now, moms bugging now  
Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house  
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it  
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet  
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it  
Couldn't though, why? 'cause I owed the nigga for it  
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola  
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck  
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda  
I remember this shit like it was yesterday  
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face  
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk  
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt  
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know  
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go  
[Chorus repeat- X2]  
I'm on the motherfucking grind  
You think this easy, you out your motherfucking mind  
You could see the shit I'm doing, if you was blind  
Straight up, I'm just trying to get mine  
[Yo Gotti]  
What am I to do now, where am I to go?  
And how the fuck I'm gonna pay this nigga for his do?  
Been looking for me, got a nigga kind of scared  
And all the other niggaz looking up side my head  
They said he came through, layin low with his beeper  
Two, Three cars Two, Three Desert Eagles  
Got me a fresh quarter ounce and a beeper  
Fuck it, I'm a grind till my bank get steeper  
72 hours had 28 elither  
Know what I'm talking about that uncut ether  
Junkies lookin whoin, goose neckin and browsing  
Word got around, I sold up the Public Housing  
[Chorus]  
[Yo Gotti]  
One week later had 4 and a split  
Called up the nigga, told him told him come get his shit  
I'm a real nigga, I just ran into some problems  
All the time you think a nigga tried to slick rob ya  
Thinking about my mama and them, I'm ready to go home  
I'm fifteen years old, out here on my own  
Mama let me back in, mama real strict  
After school, straight home, no phone, no shit  
Now doom in my room, I assume I was broke and it's true  
So what the fuck a nigga gone do  
Called grip, I heard he just got back off a trip with that shit  
Man fuck it, I'm getting back with my click  
[Chorus repeat-X2]

Randy Travis,Highway Junkie,/r/randy+travis/highway+junkie_20114193.html,"  
A hundred cups of coffee, five hundred cigarettes  
A thousand miles of highway and I ain't forgot her yet  
But I keep on moving, I keep moving down the line  
There ain't nothing in my mirror, just a cloud of dust and smoke  
But what do you expect when some old trucker's heart gets broke  
Yeah, trucker's hearts gets broke  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line  
  
Ten miles out of nashville, I was doing a hundred and one  
State boy me over and he said, ""Where's the fire, son?""  
He said, ""Where's the fire son?""  
I said ""Man, there ain't no fire, I'm just running from a flame  
Go on and write your ticket, but I ain't the one to blame""  
That county judge tried to rob me blind.  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line  
  
So I rolled on down to Memphis  
I had nothing left to lose  
I wanted to hear some rock and roll, but all they played was blues  
I didn't wanna hear no blues  
So I went to call up Elvis and Roger Miller grabbed the phone  
He said drive that 18 wheeler, boy, you're the king of the road  
Said I was the king of the road  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line

A life of crimes not easy, sometimes you need some help  
Someone to share the risks with, and to help you spend the wealth  
Some one to run the shredder, or to help you dig a hole  
But lying on the witness stand's the most important role  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
When I come home at night With blood up to my elbows,  
Skin beneath my fingernails, and brains stuck to my toes,  
Let's get the story straight because the cops are on their way  
Just sit tight, and listen, and I'll tell you what to say.  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
Don't ask any question about the money in the closet  
You'll get your share later just foget you ever saw it  
Share and share alike, that's the way it's gotta be,  
Even if it's gonna make you an accessory  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
I'm gonna be indicted for that last bank robbery  
You've got to tell the jury that it really wasn't me  
Just remember what to say when you're on the stand  
I'm sure that everything will go exactly like we planned  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day

A long time ago, Lazarus died  
All hope seemed gone as his sisters cried  
Jesus walked to where he laid  
He called his name and he came out of the grave  
  
Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?  
you thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong, I?ve been set free  
  
Oh, jesus hung on a rugged cross, he gave His life for a world once lost  
He lay three days in a borrowed grave but when He came out I could hear Him
say  
  
Oh death, where thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?  
You thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong, I?ve been set free  
  
One day I?ll lay this body down, they?ll dress me up and put me in the ground  
But when Jesus comes in the sky, just listen close and you?ll hear me cry  
  
Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?  
You thought you had a hold on me but you were wrong, I?ve been set free

A man and wife had prayed for years for children  
Were losing faith and close to giving up  
Then a young girl with no way to keep her baby  
Laid in their arms a tiny gift of love  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
A small coal mining town in West Virginia  
Prayed as they kept vigil day and night  
Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken  
But also thankful one made it out alive  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
Two thousand years ago the world lay waiting  
For the Savior they were told would come  
Then on that winter night there in a manger  
God blessed the world with his one and only son  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
It takes one honest prayer coming from your heart

Lauryn Hill,Adam Lives In Theory,/l/lauryn+hill/adam+lives+in+theory_20183101.html,"  
Adam lives in theory  
Trying to turn stone into bread  
Masquerading like he got it figured out  
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head  
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt  
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices  
Praying to the alter of himself  
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious  
Like he's got all the light, and no one else  
He takes the unsuspected  
'cause he knows they're not connected  
And he shows them how to be just as he is  
Virtually real, and commercially appealed  
To the lust of all the people where he lives  
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed  
Wanting to be intellectual  
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day  
And now she thinks that she's bisexual  
Caught up in emotion  
Burning up in her devotion  
To the king of exploitaion in the field  
She handed him her virtue  
'cause he told her ""I won't hurt you""  
So she lay with him to see how good it feels  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication  
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying  
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head  
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment  
'cause everything appears to be the same  
They entertain suggestion,  
Next time just use protection  
Desiring to cover up their shame  
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes  
To the very antidote to their dilemma  
Burning in their lust,  
Both of them were dealt to us  
Destroying the original agenda  
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie  
They exhausted every possible conclusion,  
They can't even entertain the solution,  
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution  
Hiding from the truth,  
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation  
When confronted, blamed his wife  
Giving birth to carnal life  
Refusing to acknowledge what he done  
Now if we can agree with who created us to be  
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes  
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception  
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified  
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you  
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,  
To this decaying social system  
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go  
If we love him like we say we do,  
He will try us  
Just don't regress,  
Or slip into hopelessness  
Once he's satisfied his love,  
He won't deny us,  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

Neil Sedaka,The Miracle Song,/n/neil+sedaka/the+miracle+song_20262082.html,"  
All my life  
I've been a kind of lonely man  
Searching high and low  
Looking for my way  
Then all at once  
I saw you right in front of me  
I knew right then and there  
My lonely days were through  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever, ever be  
And you're a miracle to me  
You fill my life  
With tenderness and harmony  
I never thought  
That I'd be laughing once again  
You fill the room  
With something warm and wonderful  
I can't imagine life  
Without your precious love  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever, ever be  
And you're a miracle to me  
Rivers bend rivers flow  
Till the end of time  
They keep flowing  
Through eternity  
Take me there  
Sail away  
Take me to the sea  
You're a river that flows inside of me  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That I could ever, ever see  
And you're a miracle to me

Bread,Goodbye Girl,/b/bread/goodbye+girl_20024030.html,"  
All your life you've waited  
For love to come and stay  
And now that I have found you,  
You must not, slip away  
I know it's hard believin'  
The words you've heard before  
But darlin' you must trust them just once more,  
  
'Cause baby goodbye  
Doesn't mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again  
  
If you wake up and I'm not there,  
I won't be long away  
'Cause the things you do my Goodbye Girl  
Will bring me back to you.  
  
I know you've been taken,  
Afraid to hurt again  
You fight the love you feel for me  
Instead, givin' in  
But I can wait forever,  
A-helpin' you to see  
That I was meant for you and you for me  
  
So remember goodbye  
Doesn't mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again  
  
Though we may be so far apart,  
You still will have my heart  
So forget your past my Goodbye Girl  
'Cause now you're home at last.

Almost heaven, West Virginia,  
Blue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river,  
Life is old there, older than the trees,  
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze  
  
Country roads, take me home  
To the place I belong,  
West Virginia,  
Mountain mamma, take me home  
Country roads  
  
All my memories, gather round her  
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water  
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky  
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eye  
  
Country roads, take me home  
To the place I belong,  
West Virginia,  
Mountain mamma, take me home  
Country roads  
  
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me  
Radio reminds me of my home far away  
Driving down the road I get a feeling  
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

New Order,Slow Jam,/n/new+order/slow+jam_20099847.html,"  
As I look at the morning sky  
Today the wind is blowing hard  
See that bird has flown too high  
Pretty soon it will be tired  
I spent a day all by myself  
A rich man without his wealth  
Sometimes I get it wrong  
But I'm not the only one  
  
The afternoon was very clear  
The sun was beating down on me  
I got thirsty for a beer  
That I had to go to sea  
The sea was very rough  
It made me feel sick  
But I like that kind of stuff  
It beats arithmetic  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
The early evening mist  
Looked beautiful to me  
Was sweeter than a kiss  
I wish you all could see  
I'm a long long way from home  
But this photograph of you  
Even though it's monochrome  
Tells me what I should do  
So I got up on my feet  
And I knew it would be alright  
For my clothes were looking beat  
In the middle of the night  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this

Before you take another step there's one thing you should know  
About the years ahead and how they'll be  
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow  
Cause all I have to offer you is me  
  
There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers  
And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear  
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see  
All I have to offer you is me  
  
Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can  
But be sure that's what you want while you're still free  
The only gold I have for you is in this wedding band  
Cause all I have to offer you is me  
  
There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill  
All I have to offer you is me

believe it or not I wan't always this fucking cool  
I used to get a lot of shit when I was back in school  
But one day I turned the tables on all those assholes  
I filled em' all full of 9mm bullet holes  
Murder at the senior prom  
Mass murder at the senior prom x2  
I padlocked the gym doors the night of the senior prom  
Under the bleachers I planted several pipe bombs  
Stood up on the balcony sub-machine gun in my hand  
Said ""I'm your new prom king, does everybody understand?""  
Rounded up all the jocks who used to chase me home from school  
Tied their hands and feet and pushed them in the swimming pool  
Lined all the teachers who flunked me up against a wall  
Then one by one I stuck a butcher knife into them all  
Found that little fuck who got me busted for smokin' dope  
Now he's hanging from the flag pole kicking at the end of a rope  
Last but certainly not least when everybody else was dead  
I sodomized the cheerleaders and then I cut off all their heads

Keep one of your eyes open at all times  
Think that you're on the brink?  
The shit hasn't even begun to hit the fan  
Consequence you'll see will be stranger than a gang of drunken mimes  
Situation has a stink  
Better clear the air before your son becomes a man  
  
Blink  
  
Everything's been augmented  
You've been left so far behind  
Think, for sure, next time you should wear a pair of eyes in the back of your  
head  
Consequence you've seen has been stranger than sci-fi of any kind  
Situation baffles me  
I guess it's true you are too one of the walking dead  
  
You better think fast!  
?Cause you never know what's comin' around the bend  
You better not blink!  
For consequence is a bigger word than you think  
It's bigger than you and me

Come On baby, take a look outside, it's a big blue sky  
  
We didn't listen when they tried to tell us we were to young to know  
They tried to slow us down but, we always found another way to go.  
Before you know it we were waving goodbye, driving away  
off into the big blue sky  
We went out lookin for the best jobs kids like us could get  
We got hired and fired, and worn out tired but we never quit.  
To dumb to worry or wonder why  
we were chasing our lives off into the big blue sky.  
  
Chorus  
I guess we were just  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
We've had earthquakes, twisters, hurricanes, tidlewaves and hail down n our
heads  
We've been knocke down, sucked in  
spun round, shaken up, thrown away  
and left for dead  
but somehow we always made it out alive  
on the other side of the Big Blue Sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through
anything.  
you'll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby take look at our lives it's nothing but a  
Big Blue Sky  
  
It's nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Baby lookin back  
everthing they said  
Like how we wouldn't last how far we'd never get,  
It's a great big lie  
ain't nothin over head  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through
anything.  
you'll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby look at our lives  
Take a look at our lives  
Yeah look at our lives

How could you let them get the best of you

Lies one that I love so well  
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath the willow  
Disturb not her rest in the vale

Celine Dion,Aren't They All Our Children,/c/celine+dion/arent+they+all+our+children_20684476.html,"  
Don't look away  
An innocent face  
Cries, and searches for some comfort  
Love will provide  
What fate has denied  
All they ask is simply someone  
  
With arms that reach  
And words that teach  
Will be their strength  
In times of need  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Aren't they all our children after all  
  
Who will be there  
To show them love and care  
They are this world's living treasure  
The heart of a child  
Is born to wear a smile  
And feel joyful without measure  
  
With arms that reach  
And words that teach  
Will be their strength  
In times of need  
We'll hold their hearts  
In loving hands  
Help them believe  
In love again  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Aren't we all their children after all  
  
And as they grow  
They will always know  
That love will ease their troubled road  
And you and I  
Are their wings  
To help them fly  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Aren't they all our children after all  
  
Aren't they all our children after all

Feeling good inside  
Take a look around  
Suck air into your lungs  
And stride across the ground  
You know yourself you made yourself  
Drunken with the glory  
Sober with the force  
Carelessly once more to rule without remorse  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?  
Egomaniac yes you could confide  
But they'd never understand the comfort you provide  
The splendor you have planned  
Something strange is happening to you  
You're on your own, can you hear them talking?  
Trust is an unknown, are they breaking through  
When you're the best who needs the rest  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?  
Egomaniac  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun ego may  
Weary to your bones with ease you domineer  
No challenge left to rise to  
No foeman left to fear  
In your mind you feel them breaking through  
You hardly feel the silence, all the puppet chatter gone  
Who cares that no one follows  
So long as you lead on  
Could there be another point of view  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun

Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?

Father, I confess for doing  
I had a brain, but life had to ruin it  
Dissinfected, Disected, Don't Respect It  
When you put me in a cage full of animals  
Savages and cold blooded canibals  
I can't help but come but abouts me  
try to run but they found me, surround me  
Then they choke ya, and provoke ya  
try to smoke ya, turn you into a joka  
I tried to rub it off, but its all I know  
the only thing I ever knew, so what to do  
look at you, a bigot till your growin old  
your growin mold, with a soul that's freezin cold  
so I confess, but even if I'm all wrong  
I'll be down with the clown till I'm dead and gone  
Chorus  
I confess, this lady had a purse, so I took it  
I took it home, opened it, I shook it  
she had papers, lipstick and nail polish  
credit cards and about 27 dollars  
I bought a 5th, drank it and laid there  
it seemed like, I could see the purse everywhere  
on the light post, by this mail box  
I tried to run from it, I ran a couple blocks  
but there it was, on the side walk, waitin for me  
it tried to lure me to it, I had to fuckin' do it  
I picked it up, and stuck my fuckin' hand in it  
it was full of rats, and they fuckin' bit it off  
father I confess, I'm a criminal  
but my worlds too subliminal around me  
look at them, all the wicked masses  
that's why I'm down with the clown till I'm ashes  
Chorus  
Its like a circus, a wicked carnival  
Everybodys got a tickit, they're lookin  
For the freaks, to point and gawk at  
Look at yourself, the jokes on you jack

These are men, America's best  
One hundred men we'll test today

Trained in combat, hand to hand

Courage deep from the Green Beret

Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?

Here is the gist  
A practical list of don'ts fer you  
  
Don't throw bouquets at me  
Don't please my folks too much  
Don't laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say we're in love

Give me my rose and my glove  
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things

Some people claim that you're to blame as much as I  
Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie?  
Grantin' your wish, I carved our initals on that tree  
Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free  
  
Don't praise my charm too much  
Don't look so vain with me  
Don't stand in the rain with me  
People will say we're in love  
  
Don't take my arm too much  
Don't keep your hand in mine  
Your hand feels so grand in mine

People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't dance all night with me  
'Til the stars fade from above

Hardest thing I?ve ever done, or that I?ll ever do  
Was to just walk off and leave you, but I knew I had to leave you  
Cause I couldn?t stay and watch you falling out of love with me  
The worst pain I?ve ever known, or that I?ll ever know  
Was to see your love a dying, and I have to watch it dying  
And I couldn?t stand to watch you falling out of love with me  
  
It?s hurting now but still it?s better, I left while love was still alive  
It was dying and I?d rather, I didn?t have to watch it die  
  
The deepest hurt I?ve ever felt, or that I?ll ever feel  
Was to know that I was losing, and I tried but I keep losing  
And I couldn?t stay and watch you falling out of love with me  
  
The loneliest I?ve ever been, or that I?ll ever be  
Is now that I?m without you, and I feel so lost without you  
But I couldn?t stay and watch you falling out of love with me  
  
It?s hurting now but still it?s better, I left while love was still alive  
It was dying and I?d rather, I didn?t have to watch it die  
It was dying and I?d rather, I didn?t have to watch it die

I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
1:  
Some girls, say in their world  
They couldn't bear to have just him  
But I, don't need a load of guys  
To pump up my self esteem  
  
Girl what you doin' with just one guy  
Given' all my lovin'  
What you gonna do when  
There's lipstick on his collar  
You're gonna get old before your time  
You can't tell me nothing,  
'bout this man of mine  
  
CHORUS:  
No other love could ever  
Compare to my lover  
I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
No other touch could mean half as much  
As my lover  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
2:  
Check it out  
  
Some guys never realise  
What a girl needs from a man  
But my guy always satisfies  
It's a love we understand  
  
Don't you want to go out and play  
I'm sorry but I'm busy  
What if you call and there isn't any answer  
You're gonna find him gone one day  
He'll always be with me no matter what you say  
  
CHORUS:  
  
No other kiss is the one that I miss  
With my lover  
I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
No other man could love like he can  
As my lover  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
RAP:  
Hey you kylie...mmm hmmm  
What's up with this one-boy-girl thing...well  
Let me break it down like this, yeah right  
It doesn't play to stay or be good  
You know how guys are, I don't think he good  
Be with just one, and what if he cheats ya  
Girl just have fun go out and meet ya  
Two or three more.. I don't think so  
You should see more..no I don't think so  
How could you be sure..I believe him  
You're in for heartbeat you don't need him  
What if he hurts you..he won't do that  
Are you sure...yeah that's a fact  
There's lots of guys in this world  
Not for me, I'm a one-boy-girl  
  
No other love (no other love)  
My lover, ohh  
One boy, one boy girl  
No other touch (no other touch)  
My lover, ohh  
One boy, one boy girl, yeah

It doesn't take a lot to confuse me  
I'm not aware of the passing of time  
And I'd like to say to those who accuse me  
Could you do it while you looked in my eye  
  
If you hold on primitive notion  
And if you think you'd like to try  
You can drink this magic potion  
And you can do it 'til the day that you the day that you die  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
I'm doing my best to confound you  
Your behaviour is so volatile  
Not even a zoo would impound you  
Don't look at me with your criticle smile  
  
Well I've been driving in the wrong gear  
It's been a long and lonely ride  
It's been winter for a whole year  
But you couldn't hurt me if you tried  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to be like it was at the start  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
I've got a message that I need to send  
It's coming to you straight from a friend  
I wanted to see what's inside my heart  
I wanted to be like it was in the start

From Timbuktu to old Berlin

When I see an old man die:

Ignore the judges 'til my trial

I've tried to ignore  
All the stench of your life  
Only holding back  
For my wife  
Even she has seen  
Your poisoned soul displayed  
Seen each move you've made  
Contaminate, degrade  
  
Who's this juvenile?  
Who's this infantile clown?  
He's not ever worth  
Knocking down  
Stamp your tiny foot  
My precious little lamb  
Bleat ad nauseam  
But i don't give a damn  
  
Where to go? heart ever hounded  
Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give me peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when it's too late  
  
May this imbecile  
Cause your heart to feel joy  
You did after all  
Choose the toy  
Do you now suppose  
I'll leave with no reply?  
Basic laws apply  
An eye demands an eye  
  
Where to go? heart ever hounded  
Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when it's too late

Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore  
There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world  
Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide  
Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life  
  
The lord said, ""Simon, haul your nets in  
From now on you're a fisher of men""  
Well, I like fishin',  
That's why it caught my ear  
The Lord knew how to get to me  
And what I'd need to hear  
  
Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore  
There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world  
Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide  
Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life  
  
When the sea is troubled and it's hard to stay afloat  
And you feel like Jesus is sleeping in the boat  
Don't you dare give up on the Prince of Peace  
And in the middle of the storm  
You will find a sweet release  
  
Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore  
There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world  
Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide  
Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life  
  
Yeah keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life

Last call has come and gone for us  
Down at our favorite bar.  
We got more beer at home but  
We can't walk 'cause' its too far  
Got a brand new set of wheel, and  
It's parked right out in the back  
It's called the DRUNK TANK  
And it's hell on tracks!  
We're having trouble walking  
So I guess we better drive.  
Don't even have to worry  
If we'll make it home alive.  
With twenty-seven tons  
Of fine carbon steel,  
It doesn't matter if you're fucked up  
When you get behind the wheel!  
Lock and load get on the road,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Grinding gears and pounding beers,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Inebriated, Amout plated,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Drive and swill and shoot to kill,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Set off to the bar  
With happy hour in out sights.  
Several hours later  
We'll be blacked out in a fire fight.  
Cut off by the bartender  
We'll drive right through the door  
With a cannon pointed at his head  
I bet he'll serve some more  
Flashing reds behind us  
But we won't pull to the side  
Swivel 'round the turret  
Johnny-law had better hide  
Let loose with the machine gun,  
Watch his car disintegrate.  
Now he's writing tickets  
From the wrong side of hell's gates  
Lock and load get on the road,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Grinding gears and pounding beers,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Inebriated, Amout plated,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Drive and swill and shoot to kill,  
In the Drunk Tank!

Mascara hides the sleepless nights  
Years of abuse, the downs and highs  
A lonely drunk staggers on stage  
Weathered and worn, battered and broken, I feel my age  
Like a puppet on strings, look he strums and he sings, I feel like a cartoon  
I'm alone on the stage, I'm the man on the moon  
I'm the deer in the headlights, I'm the fish in the bowl  
I'm on automatic pilot, I am remote controlled  
Just a second guitarist, playing on the 3rd string  
I'm the disclaimer, I'm a walking routine  
I'm happily a cog, stand me up, plug me in  
Like a robot I play all the songs, with a grin

Well, we hunted, talked and fished his last days away  
He was just a hired farm hand, worked old man Walker's land  
Retired on his 68th birthday  
Yeah, he wore a size sixteen shoe, had skin like alligator  
Lord, he could pick up a deer and walk right out of those woods  
Old Dillon had a million tales but he sung me one refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
One July Monday morning I met him at the fishing hole  
But old Dillon wasn't toting his half pint of tin hide  
His roll your own tobacco string was a-hanging from his pocket  
His eyes were red as beets, looked like he cried  
And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy  
But my ten year old mind didn't understand  
He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly  
Paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
  
Well, it was one year to the day on a July Monday morning  
I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon, he didn't show  
Daddy came down about noon, and said  
Son, I've got some news  
Lord's rested old Dillon's soul  
Yeah, and I walked up to his bedside  
Looked down at old big Dillon  
Lord knows that I saw a pair of wings  
That tables set but I felt good, for at last I understood  
That refrain sung by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky, Lord, y'all  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly)

Oh, stop don't change that smile honey  
That you wear up on your face  
Take it up with makeup girl  
I just know you're in the place  
When I look at you  
All my dreams come true  
My future, girl, in you I see  
You've always been for real  
And that's good enough for me.  
  
I like you the way you are, girl  
Baby don't change your love on me

Believe me girl that losing you  
Would be much than I could take  
Your loving I got used to I need it bad

David Allan Coe,Shackles And Chains,/d/david+allan+coe/shackles+and+chains_20585937.html,"  
On a long lonesome journey I am going  
So my sweet little darling don't cry  
For in shackles and chains they will take me  
To a prison to live till I die  
(chorus)  
And each night threw the bars  
I will gaze at the stars  
My dreams dear of you so in vain  
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow  
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains  
Put your arms threw these bars once more darling  
Let me kiss your sweet lips I love best  
For in sorrow they were my conculution  
And in sadness my haven of rest  
(repeat chorus)

Until morale improves.

Said I, many times, love is illusion,  
A feeling result of confusion.  
With knowing smile, and blazing sigh,  
A cynical so-and-so was i.  
I felt so sure, so positive,  
So utterly, unchangingly certain.  
But I never was aware of love and you,  
And suddenly I realized  
There was love and you,  
And I, and i.  
In this world of ordinary people  
Extraordinary people  
I'm glad there is you  
In this world of over-rated pleasures  
Of under-rated treasures  
I'm so glad there is you  
I live to love, I love to live with you beside me  
This role so new, I'll muddle through with you to guide me  
In this world where many, many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love  
I'm glad there is you  
  
In this world where many, many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love

Sleep on it, see if it makes a difference in the morning  
Go to work, get through the day and try not to remember  
Even if we had something to say,  
Would you hold it dear, would it fly away with you, with you  
  
Long ago, it felt like we were both so much younger  
Here we are a repeat of a classic situation  
Did you build us up just to say how high?  
Would you let me down?  
Even notice that I was with you, with you  
There you go, gone again without an explanation  
So anyway get through the day and try not to remember  
Even if we found nothing to say  
Would it finally hide all the reasons to stay with you, with you

From the kings and the queens and the slaves and the whores  
For every lost cause where the martyrs are found  
That funky little sound, that make you want to get down  
Somebody told me once, love makes the world go round  
Now kids they carry pistols out on the playground  
That profound, gone too far.  
Praying to the light from a burned out star  
Put your lights on, put down your crosses  
It's time to tally up your wins and your losses  
They go one for Scott La Rock  
Two for Pac and B.I.G.  
And three for all the mothers who got graves to dig  
For all the mothers who got graves to dig  
For all the mothers who got graves to dig

The Broadways,Into The Woods - Moments In The Woods,/t/the+broadways/into+the+woods+moments+in+the+woods_20543745.html,"  
Was that me?  
Was that him?  
Did a Prince really kiss me?  
And kiss me?  
And kiss me?  
And did I kiss him back?  
  
Was it wrong?  
Am I mad?  
Is that all?  
Does he miss me?  
Was he suddenly  
Getting bored with me?  
  
Wake up! Stop dreaming.  
Stop prancing about the woods.  
It's not besseming.  
What is it about the woods?  
  
Back to life, back to sense,  
Back to child, back to husband,  
No one lives in the woods,  
There are vows, there are ties,  
There are needs, there are standards,  
There are shouldn'ts and shoulds.  
  
Why not both instead?  
There's the answer, if you're clever:  
Have a child for warmth,  
And a Baker for bread,  
And a Prince for whatever-  
Never!  
It's these woods.  
  
Face the facts, find the boy,  
Join the group, stop the Giant-  
Just get out of these woods.  
Was that him? yes it was.  
Was that me? No it wasn't,  
Just a trick of the woods.  
  
Just a moment,  
One peculiar passing moment...  
Must it all be either less or more,  
Either plain or grand?  
Is it always ""or""?  
Is it never ""and""?  
That's what woods are for:  
For those moments in the woods...  
  
Oh. if life were made of moments,  
Even now and then a bad one-!  
But if life were only moments,  
Then you'd never know you had one.  
  
First a Witch, then a child,  
Then a Prince, then a moment-  
Who can live in the woods?  
And to get what you wish,  
Only just for a moment-  
These are dangerous woods...  
  
Let the moment go...  
Don't forget it for a moment, though.  
Just remembering you've had and ""and"",  
When you're back to ""or"",  
Makes the ""or"" mean more  
Than it did before.  
Now I understand-  
  
And it's time to leave the woods.

Alice In Chains,Blue,/a/alice+in+chains/blue_20521847.html,"  
Wasting doubt dwelled in me  
Life slipped by wasted teens  
Feeling small as I look around  
Why can't I cleanse myself?  
  
Fall in, face it, feel it, pray  
Weighted what you wanted me to be  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain  
  
Twirling leech, spinning down below  
Wishing for the song to write  
Leer at me, I can't see  
Am I wrong to be?  
  
(Go)  
Fall in, face it, feel it, pray  
Weighted what you wanted me to be  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?

Kim Wilde,Cambodia,/k/kim+wilde/cambodia_20078428.html,"  
Well he was Thailand based  
She was an airforce wife  
He used to fly weekends  
It was the easy life  
But then it turned around  
And he began to change  
She didn't wonder then  
She didn't think it strange  
But then he got a call  
He had to leave that night  
He couldn't say too much  
But it would be alright  
He didn't need to pack  
They'd meet the next night  
He had a job to do  
Flying to Cambodia  
  
And as the nights passed by  
She tried to trace the past  
The way he used to look  
The way he used to laugh  
I guess she'll never know  
What got inside his soul  
She couldn't make it out  
Just couldn't take it all  
He had the saddest eyes  
The girl had ever seen  
He used to cry some nights  
As though he lived a dream  
And as she held him close  
He used to search her face  
As though she knew the truth  
Lost inside Cambodia  
  
But then a call came through  
They said he'd soon be home  
She had to pack a case  
And they would make a rendez-vous  
But now a year has passed  
And not a single word  
And all the love she knew  
Has disappeared out in the haze  
Cambodia - Don't cry now - No tears now  
  
And now the years have passed  
With not a single word  
But there is only one thing left  
I know for sure  
She won't see his face again

Loretta Lynn,God's Country,/l/loretta+lynn/gods+country_20702956.html,"  
Well I was born in old Kentucky  
In them hills where folks are lucky  
From a coal miner's daughter right to a coal miner's wife  
  
Well the mountain folks love the mountains  
White lightning flowed like the fountains  
On a Sunday morning you can hear all the good folks singin  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's God's country in these hills he walks  
And in the middle of the night you can hear him talk  
It's the closest place to heaven that I know  
If you wanna get to heaven get your road map out  
It's called the bible if you have one doubt  
I guess my friends, you must be on the wrong route  
  
Well I miss the old camp meeting time and dinner on the ground  
What I miss most is everything like all the country sounds  
Like the lonesome sound of the whippoorwill sang me to sleep every night  
And the whistle of the old freight train before daylight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And my old Kentucky home's far away

well you say its always darkest  
Just before it turns pitch black  
If you ever had a good time  
You'd probably have a heart attack  
You've only got two moods  
Self pity and depression  
I'm really fucking sick of it  
So let me give you a suggestion  
Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Death might be fun why don't you try and see  
Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Just put us all out of your misery  
You think the worlds against you  
But you dring it on yourself  
I think you need a doctor  
Maybe Kavorkian can help  
Lets have your funeral now  
I'll run you over with the hearse  
Death might improve your attitude  
You know it couldn't get any worse

And all at once there's a black cloud coming made of gasoline.

One way to move forward is to learn who's stopping me.  
  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Burn! Like a fire in the ring, like a fire in the ring.  
This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution. Yeah!  
  
We looked at the price tag, and it's one we can't afford.  
We were taught that progression means accumulating more.  
Yeah, if it's up to protect ourselves well why are we at war?

I'll never turn my back on where I'm from.  
I'll never stop believing. I'll always love my home.  
But if all I love and know has just been burned,  
I know it's just still bleeding since the fire has grown.  
  
So from now on I pledge allegiance,  
To a world that's so much different.  
No one suffers, everyone is free.  
Revolution starts with me.

Yeah, you know  
It be buggin' me out, you know what I'm sayin'?  
That rap, how everybody, like, is using metaphors and all that  
It seems like everybody's some kind of metaphor freak  
Some kind of metaphorical freak or somethin', man  
You know what I'm sayin'? Word up  
So, you know what I'm saying  
You know brother's want to make a movie and all that  
You know how I mean, so I figured you know what I'm sayin'  
I'd just make a little movie with a chicken ball  
Check it  
  
If you saw the movie, Wall Street, I guess you know  
The way ya stack chips and regulate wild dough  
But ain't no G-funk, and far from my era  
Tales from the hood, your boyz will feel terror

You think of pussy until a flick like Species  
Hi-tech, ya, my pen got velocity  
Jumpin' out the SSL like Virtuosity

Get a Pocahontas

And bangin' gets monotonous  
Her ass is classic  
Cheeks was Jurassic  
Servin' a Justice  
Poetic the way I last it  
I touch ground, real windy, with my lyrics  
Make her talk in tongues, and feel the Holy Spirit  
Hear it, pulling light strings  
Got mad cast a swing  
When I do my thing, my ballz is hairy like the Lion King  
I'm in the jungle, layin' down my mack  
You brothers need to chill with that

You think I can't, fool?  
Take me away  
You think I won't, fool?  
Take me away  
You think I can't, fool?

Spyin' in pockets  
Jumpin' out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy  
  
We  
Word up,  
So your man got a good job lovin' ya so much  
Boss on his back, comin' home like, 'What the fuck?'  
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin  
That's when LL come in  
Blast a ass like Apollo 13  
Sugar get the cream  
Hoppin' dom in every direction  
What a scene  
He can't understand your best friend's plan  
Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man  
Good love, have fun, tight hugs and flowers  
I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers  
Better get down before ya cryin' at home  
I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone  
Some brother's won't appreciate that  
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack?  
Let's run it back  
See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me  
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society  
You ain't a player-hater, kid, you took her off restriction  
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction  
Kid, you know I'm game tight when you hit it tonight  
I hope she screams my name right

Indigo Girls,American Tune,/i/indigo+girls/american+tune_20067367.html,"""American Tune"" is a Paul Simon song. The girls have been performing  
It since at least 1985. A live version of it appears on the  
(promo-only) ""Reverse 1"" CD, and another on the (commercially  
Available, but kinda hard to find) ""Ben and Jerry's Newport Folk  
Festival '90"" CD.  
Many is the time I've been mistaken  
And many times confused  
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken  
And certainly misused.  
Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right  
I'm just weary to my bones  
Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home - so far away from home.  
I don't know a soul who's not been battered  
I don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered  
Or driven to it's knees  
Oh, but it's all right, it's all right  
We've lived so well, so long  
Still, when I think of the road we're travelling on  
I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong.  
And I dreamed I was dying  
Dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
And looking back down at me  
Smiled reassuringly  
And I dreamed I was flying  
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see  
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was dying.  
Oh, we come on a ship they called the Mayflower  
We come on a ship that sailed the moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hour  
And sing an American tune  
Oh, oh, but it's all right - it's all right, it's all right  
You can't be forever blessed  
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day  
And I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying - to get some rest

Too preachy. Anyway, I enjoyed the director's last film immensly.""

Unusual because you don't see them on a day to day basis.

I never thought when we broke up,  
That you'd be haunting me.  
I thought that when you let me go,  
That I would just be free.  
But I can't seem to tell my heart,  
I can't make it understand.  
There may be someone else for me,  
You're not the only man.  
And I'm still yours,  
I'm still yours.  
Oooh I'm like a slave  
Who's master,  
Cause he no longer reigns.  
Although your gone,  
My heart and my mind,  
Are still walked by your chain.  
If you can't leave my heart alone  
And stop toying with my soul,  
Then please come back.  
You've got my life to mold.  
To have, to hold.  
And I'm still yours,  
I'm still yours.  
I will always be your baby.""

Insane Clown Posse,Piggy Pie,/i/insane+clown+posse/piggy+pie_10144824.html,"""Come and get it! Woo!  
We got some fresh fills for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch!  
So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!""  
  
The first little piggy, his house is made of wood  
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood  
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine  
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine  
I rode into town with my axe in my holster  
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster  
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out  
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out  
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place  
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face  
And blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half  
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (he he)  
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead  
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head  
Since we out west, I had a little fun  
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium  
  
[Chorus]  
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie  
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die  
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)  
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!  
  
The second little piggy, his house is made of brick  
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick  
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect  
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck  
He walked in the room, and everybody rose  
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes  
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit  
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet  
Now I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?  
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up  
Old-ass man, I let him get away  
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway  
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case  
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face  
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die  
So I ragged on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The last little piggy, his house is made of gold  
He lives in a mansion on his own private road  
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait  
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate  
Cause this little piggy, must definitely fry  
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky  
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil  
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel  
People in my city, they fightin' for they meals  
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills  
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it  
So I'm a take his money stack and stuff his face with it  
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed  
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head  
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late  
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate  
Cause I need

This one goes out for everybody that lost somebody  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Be strong  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
  
Now I understand what Scarface meant  
When he said I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die  
Never in my deepest thoughts that I would imagine  
I would be the one carrying a coffin  
Yo I feel like a orphan even though I got a mom  
I'm the first born so I gotta play strong  
Memories of the past bout when we cried when we laughed  
It makes it hard, dad, for me to finish write this paragraph  
I remember when we all shoved snow frost bites and all  
Temperature forty below  
You used to call me lazy cause I said it was too cold  
But you would go in the crib fix me a fresh cup a cocoa  
I can't front  
I wish there was a sequel of the sixth sense  
So I could see dead people  
I'm so hurt, dad  
I can't cry no more  
But I know that you're knockin on heaven's door  
Peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Rest in peace, dad

Look into my eyes  
Realize I'm the same man my father was  
y'all can tell by my Pink Cadillac  
The way I clean my ride  
Old grim tilted to the side  
But what I loved most was when the God philosophize  
About the philosophies of life in its reality  
Keep the right mentality  
Don't fall into vanity  
Sometime I feel like he standin watchin over me  
Whisperin in my ear, baby boy, I'm still here  
I heard him said I'm the shadow right beside you  
And if you confused, son, I'm there to guide you  
And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I fear no evil  
For the Lord is wit me  
But don't forget that your mom's in your hands  
You two were so close  
That I finally understand  
And here's a message to your brothers and your sisters  
I'ma miss em  
No matter what I'mma be wit em  
Peace  
  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To my dad, rest in peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
I guess I'll see you at the resurrection  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To all my people that lost somebody  
Da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Put the lighters in the air  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy

In this proud land we grew up strong  
We were wanted all along  
I was taught to fight, taught to win  
I never thought I could fail  
  
No fight left or so it seems  
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted  
I've changed my face, I've changed my name  
But no-one wants you when you lose  
  
Don't give up  
Cause you have friends  
Don't give up  
You're not beaten yet  
Don't give up  
I know you can make it good  
  
Though I saw it all around  
Never thought that I could be affected  
Thought that we'd be last to go  
It is so strange the way things turn  
  
Drove the night toward my home  
The place that I was born, on the lakeside  
As daylight broke, I saw the earth  
The trees had burned down to the ground  
  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up  
We don't need much of anything  
Don't give up  
'cause somewhere there's a place  
Where we belong  
Rest your head  
You worry too much  
It's going to be alright  
When times get rough  
You can fall back on us  
Don't give up  
Please don't give up  
  
Got to walk out of here  
I can't take any more  
Going to stand on that bridge  
Keep my eyes down below  
Whatever may come  
And whatever may go  
That river's flowing  
That river's flowing  
  
Moved on to another town  
Tried hard to settle down  
For every job, so many men  
So many men no-one needs  
Don't give up  
'cause you have friends  
Don't give up  
You're not the only one  
Don't give up  
No reason to be ashamed  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up now  
We're proud of who you are  
Don't give up  
You know its never been easy  
Don't give up  
'cause I believe there's a place  
There's a place where we belong

Cold tiles beneath your knees

Spitting into your own

you took your coat off and stood in the rain,  
You were always crazy like that  
I watched from my window,  
always felt I was outside looking in on you  
You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair,  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice,  
In case you failed to see,  
This is my heart bleeding before you,  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You were always brilliant in the morning  
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on are, Baroque moved you,  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
You'd teach me of honest things  
Things that were daring, things that were clean  
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.  
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else

And the tyrants will feel the steel of the sword  
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth  
Forever to be free from their load  
  
Time has run our for all you tyrants on earth  
Your slaves are heedin' the call  
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain  
An end to your lies and your law  
  
Takin' away all your gold and your money  
Cause dead men won't need it anymore  
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips  
So now you will feel our swords  
  
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky  
The day will come when all power has been broken  
  
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell  
Satan will wait for your souls  
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead  
He won't fool our minds and our souls...anymore!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Freedom the cry of all slaves will be heard  
The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword  
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth

Bette Midler,In These Shoes,/b/bette+midler/in+these+shoes_20017089.html,"""Gentlemen, gentlemen please! Senors, por favor!""  
  
I once met a man with a sense of adventure.  
He was dressed to thrill wherever he went.  
He said, ""Let's make love on a mountaintop,  
under the stars on a big hard rock.""  
  
I said, ""In these shoes? What is this, the Peace Corps?""  
I said, ""Honey, let's do it here.""  
  
So we're sittin' at a bar in Guadalajara,  
in walks a guy with a faraway look in his eyes.  
He says, ""I've got a powerful horse outside.  
Climb on the back, I'll take you for a ride.  
I know a little place we can get before the break of day.""  
  
I said, ""In these shoes? No way, Jose!""  
I said, ""Honey, let's stay right here.""  
  
No le gusta caminar.  
No puede montar a cabailo.  
?Como se puede bailar?  
Es un escandalo!  
  
Then I met an Englishman.  
""Oh,"" he said, ""Are you American?  
Won't you walk up and down on my spine?  
It makes me feel strangely alive.""  
  
I said, ""In these shoes? Oh, I doubt you'd survive.""  
I said, ""Honey let's do it hehehehe""  
  
""Let's stay right here.""  
  
No le gusta caminar.

Surely you know you can't win  
You should've never have come near this place  
You should have stayed outside

It's too late to turn back  
Nobody asked you to try  
But they blinded you with diamonds  
And all the money that money can buy  
And I'm so afraid of being on my own

And you're way back on the downside

But for every heart they held a spade  
And you lost more than money can buy

But don't worry it gets better at the chorus"")  
  
I guess now it's time for me to throw up  
I feel it's time  
Got a picture of you beside me  
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup,  
Wash it off  
Got a fist of pure emotion  
Got a head of shattered dreams  
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind me now  
  
[Chorus]  
whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it  
I just want you back for good  
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it  
You'll be right and understood  
  
Unaware but underlined I figured out the story  
It wasn't good  
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory  
But it wasn't to be  
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free  
Can't you find a little room inside for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we'll be together, this time is forever  
So complete in our love  
We will never be uncovered again  
  
Mosh!

Paul Simon,Save The Life Of My Child,/p/paul+simon/save+the+life+of+my+child_20332992.html,"""Good God! Don't jump!""  
A boy sat on the ledge.  
An old man who had fainted was revived.  
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed  
If the boy survived.  
  
""Save the life of my child!""  
Cried the desperate mother.  
  
The woman from the supermarket  
Ran to call the cops.  
""He must be high on something,"" someone said.  
Though it never made The New York Times.  
In The Daily News, the caption read,  
""Save the life of my child!""  
Cried the desperate mother.  
  
A patrol car passing by  
Halted to a stop.  
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:  
""The force can't do a decent job  
'Cause the kids got no respect  
For the law today (and blah blah blah).""  
  
""Save the life of my child!""  
Cried the desperate mother.  
""What's becoming of the children?""  
People asking each other.  
  
When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd  
And made them wild  
In an atmosphere of freaky holiday.  
When the spotlight hit the boy,  
The crowd began to cheer,  
He flew away.  
  
""Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place.""

Neil Young,Grandpa's Interview,/n/neil+young/grandpas+interview_20536417.html,"""Grandpa, here's your coffee,""  
Said Edith, as she filled his cup.  
""Nobody'll find you here,  
And Earl is glad you guys showed up.""  
""The way things are downtown,  
You might have to stay for awhile.  
  
There was a helicopter hovering over your house  
When I talked to your neighbor, Kyle.""  
""Who the hell do they think they are,  
Invading our home like that?  
Grandma and I had to leave so fast,  
We couldn't even catch the cat.""  
  
""The helicopter scared the shit out of him,  
And it took off down a trail,  
Down past the railroad track,  
Towards the county jail.""  
  
""Jed, you really screwed up now!  
What did you have to do that for?  
Everybody wants to hang your ass,  
And here's a note from Lenore.""  
Sun touched the cold steel bars  
As she pushed the paper in.  
Jed took it up and read it  
And he couldn't hide a grin.  
  
Outside the jail window  
A crow flew across the sky,  
Completely disappearing behind each bar,  
Then a helicopter flew by.  
""Say hi to Earl and Edith.  
Tell 'm I'm doing fine.  
Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now,  
They should cut the line.""  
  
""Can grandma come and see me?  
I got a new song to sing  
It's longer than all the others combined  
And it doesn't mean a thing.""  
The noise was unfamiliar,  
Generators whirling,  
Walkie-talkies screaming,  
Vans parked in the open field.  
  
TV crews and cameras,  
They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch.  
They came through the gate and across the lawn  
Knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch.  
And grandpa saw them there,  
Looking through the venetian blind.  
""Those people don't have any respect,  
So they won't get any of mine.""  
  
""I don't wanna talk about Jed.  
I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9.  
I don't have time to talk that fast,  
And it ain't my crime.""  
  
""It ain't a privilege to be on TV  
And it ain't a duty either.  
The only good thing about TV  
Is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver.'""  
  
""'Shows with love and affection',  
Like mama used to say.  
A little Mayberry living  
Could go a long way.""  
  
He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet,  
Loaded up both barrels.  
Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off,  
And up walked a woman named Carol.  
  
""Susan Carol from Early Magazine,  
I got some questions to ask.""  
""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine!""  
Grandpa said with a gasp.  
  
Then he fell face first and let out a sigh,  
And Edith ran out in shock.  
He was looking at her from down on the floor,  
Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk.  
  
""That guy just keeps singin'!  
Can somebody shut him up?  
I don't know for the life of me  
Where he comes up with that stuff.""  
  
They laid his head on a newspaper  
With a picture of Carmichael on the front page,  
Posing with the little league baseball team,  
And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle.  
  
Grandpa died a hero.  
Trying to stop the media.  
Fighting for freedom of silence.  
Trying to be anonymous.  
  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Live so long.

I met him at the candy store.

Ya get the picture? (Yes, we see)  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
My folks were always puttin' him down.  
Down! Down!  
They said he came from the wrong side of town.  
They told me that he was bad,  
But I knew that he was sad.  
And that's why I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
One day my dad said, ""Find someone new.""  
New! New!  
I had to tell my Jimmy that,  
Whoa, we were through.  
He stood up and then he asked me why.  
But all I could do was cry.  
I'm sorry I hurt you,  
The leader of the pack.  
  
He sort of smiled and he kissed me goodbye.  
The tears were beginning to show.  
And as he drove away from me  
On that rainy, rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow.  
But whether he heard me  
I'll never, never, never, never know!  
Look out now, now, look out!  
Whoa oh no no no! Whoa no no no! No! No!  
  
I felt so helpless! What could I do-wo-wo-wo-wo?  
The only, only love that we had was through.  
At school they all stop and stare.  
I can't hide the tears.  
I just don't care!  
I will never forget you,  
The leader of the pack!  
Whoa-oo-woh! Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!

Now he's gone!

This falsehood worldly peace  
Its treaties soon will cease  
No one will be left to prove that humans existed  
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted  
We all live on one planet and it will all go up in smoke  
Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy  
And now the final scene, a global darkening  
Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruin  
Towering overhead both far and wide  
There's unknown tools for World War III  
Einstein said, 'We'll use rocks on the other side'  
No survivors, set the world afire!

I had already started -  
so I never read the story, I just saw the headline and kept going.  
A week later I said, 'My God, where's that newspaper?' I started askin people
- I figured he was the horse that belonged to some cowboy movie star, but
nobody had a horse named Pinto. So I just made him up, made him into a
childhood hero.""  
I read it in the paper just about a week ago  
It was on the back page and not many people know  
Boy it made me feel bad when I picked it up and read Pinto the wonder horse is
dead

The dusty trails're gone now but it hurts to hear it said  
Pinto the wonder horse is dead  
My memory goes back to when I was a little kid  
We believed in everything that Pinto ever did  
Will our kids have a hero half as brave or half as strong  
Pinto the wonder horse is gone  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together...  
We believed that Pinto was the fastest horse alive

How did we get from saying ""I love you"" to ""I'll see you around

Did we take it all for granted?, did it all gets thrown away?

Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust

To bloody my hands forever  
Carved my cure with the blade

Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me  
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along  
'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to a two-toned short bed Chevy  
Drivin' my first love out to the levy  
Livin' life with no sense of time  
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rockin' Me Baby""  
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies  
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along  
'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to the smell of an old gym floor  
And the taste of salt on the Carolina shore  
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends  
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives  
Takes us to another place and time  
  
So I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir  
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire  
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church  
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
To the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
I go back (I go back)  
To watchin' summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
I go back (I go back)  
To the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him

10 P.M., I feel the rain coming down  
My face feels the wet, my mind the storm  
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour  
Moving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they're mine  
  
Midnight, she sings praises in the Hall  
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recall  
Sister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin  
(""What are you doing out in the rain?"")  
She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks  
(""I've been waiting for you. Come in."")  
  
Mary, Mary just a whore for the underground  
They made you pay in guilt for your salvation  
Thought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for you  
You know too much for your own good  
Don't offer me faith, I've got all I need here

What we need is trust, to keep us both alive  
Help us make it through the night  
  
I've no more want of any faith  
Binds my arm and feed my mind  
The only peace I've ever known  
I'll close my eyes and you shoot  
  
No Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength from my lips  
I pray I feed you well  
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long  
For what you gave to everyone  
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed  
From my barrel of death, he turned the Holy water red  
As he died he said thank you  
I just watched him bleed  
  
I feel the flow, the blessed stain  
Sweating hands like fire, and flames  
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial right  
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight  
  
Mary, sweet lady of pain  
Always alone  
Blind you search for the truth  
I see myself in you, parallel lives  
Winding at light-speed through time  
  
No time to rest yet

Before madness has the final laugh  
Too much bloodshed  
We're being used and fed  
Like rats in experiments  
No final outcome here  
Only pain and fear  
It's followed us both all our lives  
There's one thing left to see  
Will it be him or me?  
There's one more candle left to light  
  
Don't turn your back on my disgrace  
The blood of Christ can't heal my wounds, so deep  
The sins of man are all I taste  
Can't spit the memory from my mind  
I can't cry anymore

Insane Clown Posse,House Of Mirrors,/i/insane+clown+posse/house+of+mirrors_20067693.html,"""Ladies and gentlemen the house of mirrors  
For just one bet venture through this wonderful exhibit  
See yourself in all the weird shapes and sizes  
You young man would you like to go into the house of mirrors  
Well okay  
Have a good time son  
And good luck finding your way out  
Wait a minute I don't like it in here  
Hey wait a minute let me out of here  
Let there's dead bodies in here  
There's dead bodies in here  
I don't like it in here!!!""  
  
Step inside, come my way  
This here is your fatal day  
You have lied, they have cried  
Now your life has been denied  
Look into the big mirror  
Your reflection is so clear  
Devil's head, rotting flesh  
With the snakes inside your chest  
In the mirror you can't hide  
You've been granted Jacob's lide  
Whipping fear, spinning pain  
All you crying is in vain  
You're the beast you never knew  
This reflects the things you do  
Others starving down the block  
Richie's heart is like a rock  
How can I make a law?  
I'm just here to break your jaw  
House of Glass, down and up  
You might get your ass cut  
Mirror of Life, Mirror of Pain  
Death, I wave my magic cain  
Your last words are those of fear  
But they go unheard in the House of Mirrors  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who's the wickedest of all  
Three blind mice, deepest fear  
Welcome to the House of Mirrors  
  
Magic wand, magic mirror  
Timeless clock says death is near  
Death is here, death is on  
My king bishop takes your pawn  
You can't break House of Mirrors  
That's bad luck for seven years  
Only in my wicked realm  
Of thee untold, now unfold  
Thinking back, what you do  
Buy a richie home or two  
Even though some down and out  
You keep what you could live without  
You're the beast you never knew  
This reflects the things you do  
Others starving down the block  
Richie's heart is like a rock  
First I grab, then I stab  
Cut you up into a slab  
Grind and twist, flick my wrist  
Toss you in the magic mist  
Look into Halls of Glass  
Every mirror shows the past  
With no love you kick the sin of face  
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Three blind mice, your worst fear  
Look into the deadly mirror  
  
Welcome to the House of Mirrors, Mr. Exec  
You should explain to E why ICP should let you live  
As you look on I see this image in your reflection  
A bigot under cover, showing no affections  
To the ghettos and the hoods  
Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good  
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow  
And when that shit happens, there's no pinion, no sorrow  
'Cause you refuse to lift a hand  
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand  
And if I were you I'd fear myself  
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth  
You just gotta let em fall  
You Violent J, ""what up"", bash that head against the wall  
And don't let him run for the door (where you goin, bitch?)  
Make him detour to the sore  
And let's wash away his bigot sins  
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends  
And let them see what they really like  
Hand-high riding the Benz and I'm a clown-riding the bike  
So look closely in the mirror  
You're the beast you never knew, so be the next to volunteer  
To live in the hood with the ICP  
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors  
  
[Chorus x2]

""Contestant number one,  
I believe first impressions last forever  
So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house  
And have dinner with me and my family  
Tell me what you would do to make  
That first impression really stick""  
  
[Violent J]  
Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it  
I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it  
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do  
And lick your momma in the eye and tell her, ""FUCK YOU!!!""  
Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti  
I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, ""Get the food ready!""  
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed  
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!  
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother  
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother  
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this  
You know for only 13, she got some big tits  
After that, your dad will try to jump again  
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin  
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware  
I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear  
  
""Now, let's me contestant number two  
He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak  
Who works for the Dark Carnival  
He says women call him stretch nuts

First thing, I could never love you  
You sound like a richie-bitch, yo, FUCK YOU!!!  
But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care  
By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here  
I'd go through your phone book and whack em all  
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!)  
Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay  
I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day  
I'd grab your titties and stretch em down past your waist  
Let em go, and watch em both spring up in your face  
I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can  
Get you naked, and hit it like a CAVEMAN!!!  
When we go to the beach and walk through the sand  
I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin  
As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back  
And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!  
  
""Well it sounds like contestant number two  
Is just over-flowing with sensativity, Sharon  
It's a touch choice so far  
Sharon, let's have your last question and  
See which one is going to win the rights to your neden""  
  
""Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the  
same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would  
your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins!""  
  
[Violent J]  
Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar  
And tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are  
I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake  
And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Rickie Lake!  
  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick  
I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick  
And then to get your attention in the crowded place  
I'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face  
  
[Violent J]  
Yeah, freak with your nuts, yo, that'll get her  
Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better  
Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap  
Shit, you don't want contestant number two  
He's mad-whack  
  
[Violent J]  
I walk into a bar and there he was  
Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it  
It was a big fucking smelly, ass farm llama

Tell their stories from way back then  
She remembered the story of Jonathan

In a part of ancient Greece  
In an ancient land called Macedonia  
Was born a son  
To Philip of Macedon  
The legend his name was Alexander  
  
At the age of nineteen  
He became the Macedon King  
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor  
By the Aegian Sea  
In 334 B.C.  
He utterly beat the armies of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men  
  
King Darius the third  
Defeated fled Persia  
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes  
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well  
And he founded the city called Alexandria  
  
By the Tigris river  
He met King Darius again  
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela  
Entering Babylon  
And Susa, treasures he found  
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a God amongst mortal men  
  
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke  
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'  
And legend said that who untied the knot  
He would become the master of Asia  
  
Helonism he spread far and wide  
The Macedonian learned mind  
Their culture was a western way of life  
He paved the way for Christianity  
  
Marching on, marching on  
The battle weary marching side by side  
Alexander's army line by line  
They wouldn't follow him to India  
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory  
  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
He died of fever in Babylon

But to somebody else  
And you made it so perfectly clear  
Still I wish you were here now

Judy Garland,Carolina In The Morning,/j/judy+garland/carolina+in+the+morning_21021272.html,"""Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina""  
  
Wishing is good time wasted,  
Still it's a habit they say,  
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,  
That's all I do all day.  
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,  
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning.  
  
When the morning glories  
Twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories  
I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early  
In the morning.  
  
Butterflies all flutter up  
And kiss each little buttercup  
At dawning.  
If I had Aladdin's lamp  
For only a day  
I'd make a wish  
And here's what I'd say  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
Dreaming was meant for night time  
I live in dreams all the day,  
I know it's not the right time,  
But still I dream away  
What could be sweeter than dreaming,  
Just dreaming and drift away.  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning.

Gordon Lightfoot,A Lesson In Love,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+lesson+in+love_20061565.html,"""Nothing is for certain""  
That's what the showman said  
First you must open the curtain  
And stand 'em on their heads  
There can be no inhibitions  
No prima donna ways  
If you want to pass the audition  
And times is tough these days  
Remember when Mr. Barnum  
Presented Jenny Lind  
They named a candy after her  
A circus after him  
End of my story  
The rest is history  
She in all of her glory  
He lived quietly  
He needed her, she needed him  
As sure as the skies above  
In a way it was for them  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love  
You look like the moon glow  
That follows me home  
Always makes me turn around  
Won't leave me alone  
First to come are the midgets  
A monkey and a kid  
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers  
The ego and the id  
Songs of the season  
Apples of the sun  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just a time for each and every one  
Hang on Mr. Barnum  
Hang on Jenny Lind  
We will meet you in streets of gold  
Where eternity begins  
We will let it all hangout  
Go hand in glove  
Life was meant to live and learn  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love

They crack a smile, talk a while,  
Try to take your place  
My memories serve me far too well  
It's not like at all  
We just broke up  
It's not like at all  
It was yesterday  
But something I just can't explain  
Something  
And no one ever saw your face again  
Just say good bye to the stupid mistakes we made  
My memories serve me far too well  
The years will come and go  
Some of them will change our lives  
Some of us still have nothing to show  
nothing baby  
But memories  
And I just wish to see your face again  
Won't you keep waiting for that day?  
I know I know I know  
You hear these words that I say  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want

Iron Maiden,Revelations,/i/iron+maiden/revelations_20068033.html,"""O God of Earth and Altar,  
Bow down and hear our cry,  
Our earthly rulers falter,  
Our people drift and die,  
The walls of gold entomb us,  
The swords of scorn divide,  
Take not thy thunder from us,  
But take away our pride.""  
(G. K. Chesterton English Hymnal)  
  
Just a babe in the black abyss,  
No reason for a place like this,  
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,  
An easy way for the blind to go,  
A clever path for the fools who know  
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
She came to me with a serpent's kiss,  
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,  
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,  
So we lay in the black embrace,  
And the Seed is sown in a holy place  
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.  
  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
Bind all of us together,  
Ablaze with Hope and Free,  
No storm or heavy weather  
Will rock the boat you'll see.  
The time has come to close your eyes  
And still the wind and rain,  
For the one who will be King  
Is the Watcher in the Ring,  
It is You  
It is You

This is a song that uhh..  
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh..  
Not too many Chanukah songs.  
So uhh..  
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to  
Hear any Chanukah songs.  
Here we go...""  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
Here comes Chanukah  
So much funukah  
To celebrate Chanukah  
Chanukah is the festival of lights  
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights  
  
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree  
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me  
David Lee Roth lights the menorah  
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah  
  
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli  
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli  
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too  
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew  
  
You don't need ""Deck The Halls"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock""  
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr.Spock- both  
Jewish  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
It's time for Chanukah  
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs  
Celebrates Chanukah  
  
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew  
But guess who is? Hall of famer Rod Carew- he converted  
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby  
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish- not too shabby  
  
Some people think that Ebenezer  
Scrooge is  
Well he's not, but guess who is  
All three Stooges  
So many Jews are in showbiz  
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is  
  
Tell your friend Veronica  
It's time to celebrate Chanukah  
I hope I get a harmonicah  
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah  
So drink your gin and tonicah  
And smoke your marijuanikah  
If you really, really wannakah  
Have a happy, happy, happy,  
Happy Chanukah  
  
Happy Chanukah

""Beg them to repent so they might be saved  
From the fury and the anger that shall claim them""  
  
And so they set sail across the land ans seas alike  
In a quest to avoid the setting of the sun  
  
""God's rage is true  
He urges you  
To awake... ""  
  
""Thou has stolen, betrayed  
And worshiped pagan gods  
Thou must awake, thy lost faith to be saved""  
  
And so spoke the propets,  
As the mob has gathered round  
(They) said their empire would soon crumble  
And fall down  
  
""Thou art our our brothers, hear our call this day  
We come not to see your end,  
But to revive we pray""  
  
""God's rage is true

To awake... ""  
  
""Where did these three come from""  
Asked the crowd anxiously  
Furious and confused at the same time,  
""Surely these people are lying or jesting.  
Either way they are here to cause harm. ""  
  
""You just be on your way"", said the mob as a  
Warning, ""or else (all) hell will break loose!""  
""It's all a matter of choice..."" said the Eagle,

Guns the size of children, now don't be childish  
Be with wild-ass niggas and I am the wildest.  
I'm a motherf-cker, call me Weezy baby  
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato  
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady  
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady

And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran

Comfortable, with the sound in audio  
Kickin', high hats just tickin'

Beat on steel, break tons of wood.. down with a funky sound  
Square mixer, the record is round

Shock the rhythm, and just keep learning

Messages, clues from a murderer

And aluminum, wrapped in all foil

I can tell when they spit and degrade me.  
There's only one house left, the last on the block.  
Old Man Willie on the hilltop.  
I ring the doorbell, the door creeps open.  
And there it was starin' and scopin'.  
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin'  
I was trippin'. ""Ahh, seeya!""  
I ran home. I couldn't stop thinking  
About his eyeball winking and blinking.  
And it looked not a damn thing like the other. Ugh!  
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker.  
It hypnotized me, mesmerized me.  
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me.  
Creepers, where'd you get that ball?  
And tell me how it even fits in your skull.  
  
I want a big long knife to stick it in.  
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in.  
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard.  
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye!  
  
[Chorus]  
Evil eye...  
Oh-Oh-Eye (The bitch gon' die! Die-die-die-die-die-die-die)  
Evil eye...  
Oh Oh  
  
""Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you  
should've seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with caution
with  
what  
foresight, with what patience I went to work. I was never kinder to the old
man  
than  
during the whole week before I killed him.""  
  
A day gone pass since I heard about J.O.  
Met up in this sleigh, 'cause I don't fuckin' play.  
Anyway, I gotta do him in. Got a rusty revolver  
Put the silver bullets in.  
I'm plannin' on playin' one right to his nugget.  
Down my drawers with the bucket.  
It's time to go, fuck it.  
I stuck it up... to his neck when he came to the door.  
I really didn't know what I was in for.  
First the cold man stared, no a gaze, no a stare.  
Kinda like there was no one there.  
How weird, my body froze with the blink of his eye.  
Evil eye, sendin' chills up my spine.  
What to do? What to do? I gotta try to break.  
I gotta try to make.. my way to the gate.  
Wait. I can't move, I'm stuck to the ground.  
W-What the fuck was that? I think I heard a sound,  
Turned around, there it was, starin' at my face.  
This little old man's eye's a make me a mental case.  
That's when I felt the pain deep inside,  
Deep inside, now his eye's open wide.  
  
I want a big long knife to stick it in.  
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in.  
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard.  
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""That night it ceased. The old man was dead. I placed my hands on the heart
and  
there for many minutes there was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye will  
trouble me  
no longer. His eye will trouble me no longer.""  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Amy Grant,Angels,/a/amy+grant/angels_20007715.html,"""Take this man to prison,"" the man heard herod say,  
And then four squads of soldiers came and carried him away.  
Chained up between two watchmen, peter tried to sleep,  
But beyond the walls an endless prayer was lifting for his keep.  
Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell,  
And the chains that bound the man of God just opened up and fell,  
And running to his people before the break of day,  
There was only one thing on his mind, only one thing to say:  
  
Angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angels watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
God only knows the times my life was threatened just today.  
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way.  
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown,  
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.  
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night.  
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight  
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away.  
If you're asking what's protecting me then you're gonna hear me say:  
  
Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angles watching over me!

But he stood there like some idol  
And he listened like some temple  
And then he turned away  
  
All along the fateful coast  
We moved silent like a ghost  
The timeless sea, a tireless host possessed us  
The wind came building from the cold northwest  
And soon the waves began to crest  
Crashing cross the forward deck

King Diamond,Arrival,/k/king+diamond/arrival_20078673.html,"""That must be it""  
  
Through the summer rain of 1845  
The coach had finally arrived  
To the valley where the crossroads meet below  
And where all darkness seems to grow  
People blame it on the Hill  
The hill where no one dares to go  
The Mansion  
  
The coach had stopped and from the window you could see  
Seven horsemen in the night  
Miriam Natias and Jonathan LaFey  
Saw the magic in their eyes  
They were in for a surprise  
The darkness would soon be complete  
A horseman came forth from the dark  
  
""We know you've come to inherit what's your's, the mansion  
Take our advise and go back on this night  
If you refuse eighteen will become nine, oh no""  
Oh eighteen is nine  
  
Jonathan laughed and said ""get out of my way""  
""I don't believe a word You say""  
The seven horsemen disappeared into the night  
And said ""someday you'll need our help my friend""  
  
I think poor Jonathan was scared  
  
Eighteen is actually nine, it stuck in his mind

He gave up a little death,  
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat.  
I knew it was a caper,  
I said: ""please don't kill my mother"", so he raped her.  
Tied me up, took me outside,  
And I was thrown in a big truck.  
And it was packed like sardines,  
Pull of niggers who fell for the same scheme.  
Took us to a place and made us work,  
All day and we couldn't have shit to say.  
? up the families forever,  
Until this day black folks can't stick together,  
And it's I, broke us down, made us pray to his God.  
And when I think about it,  
It makes me say damn, I want to kill Sam.  
  
Now in '91, they want to tax me,  
I remember the son of a bitch used to axe me.  
And hang me by a ? till my neck snapped,  
Now the sneaky motherfucker wants to ban rap.  
And put me on the dirt or concrete,  
But God can see through a white cheek.  
'Cause you're the devil in drag,  
You can burn your cross while I burn your flag.  
Try to give me the HIV,  
So I can stop making babies like me.  
And you're giving dope to my people Chuck,  
Just wait till we get over that, huh.  
'Cause your ass is grass 'cause I'm a blast,  
Can't bury rap, like your buried jazz.  
'Cause we stop being whores, stop doing floors,

In the blue of the air  
Open your eyes  
Why use up your life for anything else?  
No need to fight for what everyone has  
What do you need?  
It's already there  
It's already there  
  
You could love  
  
So he carried the stars in his pocket  
Drank the sunrise till he was drunk  
He embraced the angels  
They swam like little minnows in his blood  
Ghosts in his eyes  
Out walking beside him  
Laughing like children in his mind  
They chanted his mantra together  
  
You could love  
  
They were happy

Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark

Deep in the project halls waitin' to shine  
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs  
In the hood, niggas put twenty on Hoopties  
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie  
And keep dough on the flip, a hoe on the strip  
And roll dick throw on the flip  
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun  
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?  
Far from ya Hollywood  
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood  
From project chicks with hips and slim waists  
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths  
O.G, I spit G to the young ones  
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from

Blink to long ya life is gone, in the hood  
Convicts still live with they mom  
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm, in the hood  
Crack fiend'd furnish a 'Llac, in the hood

In the streets the ghetto is hot  
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops, in the hood  
The ones you love'll fill you with slugs, in the hood  
Babies born addicted to drugs, in the hood  
We make life or death decisions  
And the school system is like a minimal prison  
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin  
In the hood, it ain't all good, repent or you sinnin

""You just can't win it  
Everybody's in it for their own gain  
You can't please 'em all  
There's always somebody calling you down  
  
I do my best  
And I do good business  
There's a lot of people asking for my time  
They're trying to get ahead  
They're trying to be a good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
There was nobody calling me up for favors  
  
And no one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow  
But for the work I've taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song  
I deal in dreamers  
And telephone screamers  
Lately I wonder what I do it for  
If l had my way  
I'd just walk out those doors  
  
And wander  
Down the Champs Elysees  
Going cafe to cabaret  
Thinking how I'll feel when I find  
That very good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
Nobody was calling me up for favors  
No one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow

Here's a hint of gold  
Stuck into a tooth  
Pardon me mieseur

Add it to the stack  
Here among the sewer rats  
A breath away from hell

Well someone's got to clean them up my friends

Someone's got to collect their odds and ends

Here's a tasty ring  
Pretty little thing  
Wouldn't want to waste it  
That would really be a crime  
Thank you sir I'm in your debt  
  
Here's a little toy  
Take it off the boy  
His heart's no longer going  
And he's lived his little time  
But his watch is ticking yet  
  
Well someone's got to clean them up my friends  
Before the little harvest disappears into the mud  
Someone's got to collect their odds and ends  
When the gutters run with blood  
  
It's a world where the dog eats dog  
And they kill for the bones in the street  
And God in his heaven  
He don't interfere  
Cause he's dead as the stiffs at my feet  
  
I raise my eyes to see the heavens  
And only the moon looks down  
The harvest moon shines down

Good evening Mort Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight: Police and  
investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody stole four
dead bodies from the  
Wayne County morgue late Monday night. Police say the apparent body thief
entered  
through the basement window but how they eluded the security and alarm system
is still a  
mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering: What kinda sick FUCK would
steal four  
dead bodies anyway? Details at 11.""  
  
Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street.  
55-65, bodies at least.  
I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn.  
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn.  
Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven.  
Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'.  
Tastes like chicken, finger lickin' deep fried.  
I ate a dead body, but don't tell. I lied.  
I just ate my first dead body last week,  
Still got the fingernail caught in my teeth.  
Before ya start yellin' and cursin' my name,  
Remember somethings wrong with my brain, insane.  
Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall.  
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall.  
I'm sliding and I'm boucin' off shit like a hockey puck.  
And my mother's like, ""What the fuck?!""  
He said I was born of an alien race.  
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face.  
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand.  
I'm just a dead body man.  
  
""We've got bodies! Dead bodies! We got fat ones, skinny ones, males, females,  
hermaphrodites! We got somebodies! We got nobodies! Bodies, bodies, bodies!  
WOO!""  
  
Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van.  
All the little kiddies love the dead body man.  
I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell.  
Some people run cause they don't like the smell.  
Others line up just as quick as they can.  
To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man.  
It's all good, if you can stand the funk. but uh.....  
Just don't look in the trunk.  
I drive down central kickin' the bass.  
Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face.  
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head.  
Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead.  
I'm a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut.  
A dead body bitch learned to keep her mouth shut.  
Riding in the back is my dead body crew.  
Only they can never think of nothin' to do.  
If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself.  
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf.  
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand.

Light of love in each moonbeam  
Want you step into my dream  
Everlasting moon (everlasting moon, everlasting moon)  
  
Back when nature ruled the heavens  
Oh gypsies, fools, and loons  
Were dragged across the ocean  
By that everlasting moon  
  
When it goes from full to crescent  
I move in and out of tune  
It's the envy of the Kremlin  
It's our everlasting moon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shinin' in the sky  
The perfect alibi  
Baby come outside with me  
There's this moon you've got to see  
Smiling every place

[Intro: Fabolous]  
Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x3]  
F-A-be  
Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x2]  
F-A-be  
Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Ain't no tellin' what this hip lowered do to me  
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now  
Dip-low immunity  
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me  
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly  
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V  
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe  
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me  
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?  
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry  
So when I ask ""you want to leave the zip-code?""  
Say ""sure"" and be me  
  
[Chorus 1: Fabolous]  
But this is my party  
Stroll by if you want to  
Or y'all can stay home  
But why would you want to?  
  
[Fabolous]  
We gon' party, till we laid in graves  
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves  
Then scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""  
That groupie made her wait  
Cause when she seen the whips and chains  
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon  
  
[Chorus 2: x2]  
This is my party  
So get fly if you want to  
Get high if you want to cause I know you want to  
Put your hands up as high as you want to  
And if it feels good scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""  
  
[Fabolous]  
I don't know about y'all  
But we doin' it over here  
All the glasses got liquid that brewin' it over here  
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here  
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here  
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear  
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this  
You see why we asks is to see ID  
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access  
Me I relax this (easy)  
Cause I'm used to ballin'  
You could tell that these guys need practice  
But if it was a problem then I would confront you  
You saying ""over"" bet ya I say ""you want to""  
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put  
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look  
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook  
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale  
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell  
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell  
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well  
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail  
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail  
The Street Family speed off six SL's  
To all them chicks at Yale ""hey-hey-hey-hey yo""  
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well  
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell  
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view  
Girl I know that these guys say they want you  
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday  
Same hoes from yesterday  
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday  
Her hang-overs yesterday  
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today  
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Hey-hey-hey yo  
Hey-hey-hey yo

Gloria Estefan,Can't Stay Away From You,/g/gloria+estefan/cant+stay+away+from+you_20060697.html,"""Time flies when you're having fun""  
I heard somebody say  
But if all I've been is fun then baby let me go  
Don't wanna be in your way  
  
And I don't wanna be your second choice  
Don't wanna be just your friend  
You keep telling me that you're not in love  
You wanna throw it all away  
  
But I can't stay away form you  
I don't wanna let you go  
And though it's killing me, that's true  
There's just some things I can't control  
  
Your love is slipping through my hands  
And though I've heard it all before  
I know you're telling me the truth  
I know it's just no use  
But I can't stay away from you  
  
Hold on to every bit of hope that's all I ever do  
Hoping you might change  
Your mind and call me up  
To say how much you need me too  
  
And though you're leaving me no other choice  
That to turn and walk away  
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there  
You can count on me to stay  
  
'Cause I can't stay away from you  
I don't wanna let you go  
And though it's killing me, that's true  
There's just some things I can't control  
  
Your love slipping through my hands  
And though I've heard it all before  
I know you're telling me the truth  
I know it's just no use  
But I can't stay away from you  
  
I know you're telling me the truth  
I know it's just no use  
But I can't stay away from you

Rush,Xanadu,/r/rush/xanadu_20119977.html,"""To seek the sacred river Alph  
To walk the caves of ice  
To break my fast on honey dew  
And drink the milk of Paradise...""  
  
I had heard the whispered tales  
Of immortality  
The deepest mystery  
From an ancient book, I took a clue  
I scaled the frozen mountain tops  
Of eastern lands unknown  
Time and man alone  
Searching for the lost, Xanadu  
  
Xanadu,  
To stand within The Pleasure Dome  
Decreed by Kubla Khan  
To taste anew the fruits of life  
The last immortal man  
To find the sacred river Alph  
To walk the caves of ice  
Oh, I will dine on honey dew  
And drink the milk of Paradise  
  
A thousand years have come and gone  
But time has passed me by  
Stars stopped in the sky  
Frozen in an everlasting view  
Waiting for the world to end  
Weary of the night  
Praying for the light  
Prison of the lost, Xanadu  
  
Xanadu,  
Held within The Pleasure Dome  
Decreed by Kubla Khan  
To taste my bitter triumph  
As a mad immortal man  
Nevermore shall I return  
Escape these caves of ice  
For I have dined on honey dew  
And drunk the milk of Paradise

What would you sell?  
Loose glasses and suit  
Heart and soul  
Won't wear out  
  
That's not enough!  
I wonder what's inside  
Fish fillet knife  
Can cut  
Right through my eye...  
  
I'm looking for some words  
To call my own  
Worn-out phrases  
And a hand-me-down  
  
They'll knock me  
Under where I stand  
Sad on his back  
In a corned beef pan  
  
Going under  
You can feel them pulling me down  
To the rust inside...  
  
This is the way...  
Franken-star is born  
  
Bits and pieces  
Others have worn  
All held together by a management glue  
Too much glue  
Watch the stars turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
  
I'm going under  
You can feel them pulling me down  
To the halls of rust  
Eeh...  
  
I, I, I, I, I...  
Thank you...

King Diamond,Slippery Stairs,/k/king+diamond/slippery+stairs_20242754.html,"""Wake up Abigail"", midday, Henry was at her door  
The Count would not rise 'til the afternoon and lunch was for two  
So they talked about Miriam and then Abigail said:  
""What about Little One?""  
Henry froze: ""Oh, you mean our ghost?""  
  
""Downstairs on the lowest floor  
That's where you will find THE DOOR  
Beyond which there ware slippery stairs  
Leading down to the crypt  
  
And Little One sleeps there during the day  
But at night she'll rise, searching for her Mom  
Don't you ever go there at night, it's a sinister place  
There's so much pain, so much death, so much nothingness""  
  
When night time came on the second day and dinner it was done  
Jonathan's headache it was gone  
""Miriam please take my hand"", then his mood really changed  
""Time is right to produce an heir""  
  
Playing along with his eerie game she followed him up the stairs  
Up to a room where love they would share  
To a room that smelled as if Miriam was still in there  
  
Jonathan was a hideous sight  
So Abigail she hilled the candlelight  
What was to come, should have never been done  
She was blocking her mind from his awful thing  
In her mind his moaning became  
Nothing but falling on slippery stairs  
Falling and crying, crawling and dying  
At the end of the stairs  
  
Her eyes turned black in disgust  
Hating him more with every thrust  
And then it was over before it begun  
He was done oh what a man  
  
The only time he would call her MINE

In the middle of dying. Jonathan's charred body was  
Falling down

On his head a bucket of chicken bones, on his face a plaster mask.  
He's the bastard son of a preacher man, on the town he left a stain.  
They made him live in a chicken house to try to and hide the shame.  
  
He was born in a coop, raised in a cage. children fear him, critics rage.  
He's half alive, he's half dead. folks just call him buckethead.  
  
Farmers would torment him as he snuggled with the hens.  
They'd hose him down with water, and steal his little friends.  
Now late at night he'd sneak off to the graveyard all alone,  
And play a soapbox guitar to the faces made of stone.  
  
Buckethead found his freedom at the age of 17,  
When he burned the chicked house down with a quart of gasoline.  
He did puppet shows on corners and bought a real guitar,  
And with the help of colonel sanders, he's bound to be a star.  
  
He was born in a coop, raised in a cage. children fear him, critics rage.  
He's half alive, he's half dead. folks just call him buckethead.

Stubbed-toe effects  
And juts like after she heard the word, 'Iridescent'  
And everything was iridescent for awhile  
It wasn't long before she exalted out of nowhere  
Isn't this exquisite?'  
Once you've said, 'mmm' in unison  
And, 'oh' in double surprise  
And shared relief with a mutual, 'phew'  
And a look in each others eyes  
I tell her that is isn't, insisted that it isn't  
Because like love it has too-cunning effects, yeah  
I told her that it isn't that it's just exquisite  
Because like love it has it's barbarous threats  
""Why is the world so creepy?"", she asked  
After a car full of haircuts drove past  
A backseat full of the boys  
Breaking glass, throwing off glass

Turned on his radio and picked up the noise

Not Mr. Spit with his abrupt delivery  
And Mr. Intelligent is just a wannabe like me  
And who makes the breakfast?

""Man, it's just a dream""

A familiar voice comes shining through

Perry Como,I Know,/p/perry+como/i+know_20106860.html,"( I Know, I know, oh yes, I know! )  
I know what it means  
To be lost in the dark!  
I know what it means  
To be tossed by the storm!  
I have walked alone  
With a heart of stone  
And despair too heavy for tears,  
But you caught my heart  
And you taught my heart  
To forget it's doubts and fear!  
And now that I know  
The joy of your love  
My head is high, I can face the sky  
And know that heaven is here below,  
I know . . .  
For you I could die,  
For you I will live,  
I know!

I'm gonna dress up right, and be the best they've ever seen

That they're never impressed, that they're never impressed  
From the way they walk round, from the way they walk round  
They are used to the best, they are used to the best  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Why let them break you in with self-sophisticated praise  
'cause when the cards are low you see the smile come on their face  
If you speak the right words, if you speak the right words  
They will hear what you say, they will hear what you say  
They will take your attention, just take your attention  
And then turn away, and then turn away  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Just one thing before you go my ladies of the night  
Just one thing I have to say I've got you, and you're  
Confident and debonair you move between the stars  
Hungry for those staring eyes that fill your waking hours  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Your face is all run dry with all the echoes of the night  
And so I'm home alone, I wash my head and hold on tight  
If you speak the right words, if you speak the right words  
They will hear what you say, they will hear what you say  
They will take your attention, just take your attention  
And then turn away, and then turn away  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight, going down town tonight

I still remember, it was autumn and the moon was shining  
Our '60 cadillac was rolling through nebraska whining  
Doing a hundred-twenty, man the fields was bending over  
Hauling up for the mountains knowing we was traveling further  
All our fires were blazing and the spinning wheels were turning, turning  
Had my girl beside me, brother, brother, she was burning, burning  
I walked up back to speak to this southern funky school teacher  
She had a lot of something heavy but we couldn't reach her  
We told her that we needed something that would get us going  
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showing  
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up  
The cop came busting in and then we lit out in a pickup truck  
Go! get out of denver, better go, go  
Get out of denver, better go  
Get out of denver, better go, go  
Get out of denver  
'cause you look just like a commie and you might just be a member  
Better get out of denver, better get out of denver  
Well, red lights were flashing and the sirens they were screaming  
We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreaming  
Made it to lovely pass in under less than half an hour  
Lord, it started drizzling and it turned into a thundershower

We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreaming  
Made it to lovely pass in under less than half an hour

The rain was driving but the caddy kept on burning rubber  
We kept on driving 'til we ran into some fog cover  
We couldn't see a thing but somehow we just kept on going  
We kept on driving all night long and then into the morning  
Morning fog had lifted when we looked to see where we was at  
We're staring at a colorado state policeman trooper cat  
Go! get out of denver, better go, go

and she has been faithful to her love!

And I can't lie girl  
Ahhhhhhh  
  
Chorus:  
I'm afraid  
That your cheating  
Must have been

Neglectin your trust

I'm afraid  
That your givin' up  
I did to much  
My love rite now  
It's all about us  
All about  
All about us  
My love  
  
It's kinda crazy  
About my baby  
She was  
Neva complainin'  
She was neva  
Fed up with me  
But I kept  
On changin' one time  
Had the nerve to say  
That she was lammin'  
She couldn't compare  
Thoose otha girl  
Wouldn't care  
To deal with me  
  
(Repeat 2nd verse)  
  
(Chorus)

stranger... In my own house)  
I come stumbling in at a quarter to three  
To the sound of my own dog growlin' at me  
I'm scared to move or turn on a light  
You've got me creepin' around in the dark  
Like a thief in the night  
I've got no excuse, I should have known  
I've got no place to live  
I never feel at home  
  
I walk into the kitchen to see what's there  
I'm tired and I'm hungry but the cupboard's bare  
I've been working all day and all night too  
I can't believe this is all I have to come back to  
  
I guess I'll take a look upstairs, in the danger zone  
I wonder what I'm doing here  
When I never feel at home  
  
I'm a stranger in my own house  
I've got the keys to the door  
But I'm still locked out  
I'm a stranger in my own house  
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow this house down  
Can't be a stranger in my own house  
  
I see the do not disturb sign on my bedroom door  
What is this sheet and pillow laying on the floor  
I wore out my welcome  
I hear you loud and clear  
It's time to get a few things straight around here  
  
I've got no excuse, I should have known  
I've got a place to live but I never feel at home  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
I've got the keys to the door  
But I'm still locked out  
Stranger in my own house  
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow this house down  
Can't be a stranger in my own house  
  
I've got no excuse, I should have known  
With a woman like you I'm better off alone  
I'm a stranger in my own house  
I've got the keys to the door  
But I'm still locked out  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
Oh, honey I'm home  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
You got a lion on your hands girl, not a mouse!  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
Well, somebody's got to go...  
Stranger

Zao,All Else Failed,/z/zao/all+else+failed_10198431.html,"(A throne in Heaven sat empty for 33 years.) Why? For what do we strive that
will bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand
years we've chokedon our efforts. Only tolay down and die. Things change, and
things stay the same. Through all these trials I cannot compose myself. Till
there is a time no heaviness fills my heart. I canot compose myself. So in all
this, there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For
generation upon generation God retained a silence that shattered the hearts of
men. And for a season, all else failed. There is no other name, given among
men whereby they might be saved. In all these years when men crawled the earth
choking on his tears, no composure, nor completion reigned. No self righteous
cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man... No human effort
can bring holyness or even the strength to stand. There is  
no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant is
Jesus.

Let me tell you about a man I knew  
Yeah, I knew him all too well  
  
My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight  
But not for tomorrow  
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford  
More than you can borrow  
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I  
Pick their pockets hey  
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train  
And make my getaway  
  
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night  
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine  
  
I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes  
Did something strange to me  
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride  
But there was a fork in the street  
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules  
That I've been taught  
You never get involved, never drop your defences  
But this time I got caught  
  
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night  
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine  
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes  
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine  
  
Feels so good, I want more, it should be against the law

What is really best for us  
She's sophisticated

Celine Dion,Beauty And The Beast,/c/celine+dion/beauty+the+beast_20028291.html,"(Alan Menken, Howard Ashman)  
  
Tale as old as time  
Truth as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Than somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
Just a little change  
Small, to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the Beast  
  
Ever just the same  
Ever a surprise  
Ever as before  
Ever just as sure  
As the sun will arise  
  
Tale as old as time  
Tune as old as song  
Bittersweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  
  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as rhyme  
Beauty and the beast.

Oops I've got a lot of money  
I'm caught in a rat race terminally  
I'm a professional cynic  
But my heart's not in it  
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit  
Caught up in the century's anxiety  
It preys on him, he's getting thin  
  
Now he lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
Watching afternoon repeats  
And the food he eats in the country  
He takes all manner of pills  
And piles up analyst bills in the country  
It's like an animal farm,  
Lots of rural charm in the country  
  
Now he's got morning glory, and life's a different story  
Everything going Jackanory  
In touch with his own mortality  
He's reading Balzac, knocking back Prozac,  
It's a helping hand  
That makes you feel wonderfully bland  
Oh, it's the century's remedy for the faint at heart,  
A new start  
  
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
He's got a fog in his chest  
So he needs a lot of rest in the country  
He doesn't drink smoke laugh  
He takes herbal baths in the country  
Oh, it's like an animal farm  
But you'll come to no harm in the country

We could see the fall as a martyr understands.  
When the chorus calls there's no room for hope inside.  
Lose it all when the scream subsides.  
  
(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.  
  
Yes, we took the role of the lovers and the friends,  
And we played the parts 'til the words came to an end.  
But the tongues were tied in the passion and the pride.  
Wasted all when the scream subsides.  
  
(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.

There where no cuckoos, no sycamores  
We played about the forest floor  
Underneath the silver maples, the balsams and the sky  
We popped the heads off dandelions  
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes  
Rested on the riverbank  
And grew up by and by, and grew up by and by  
  
Frail my heart apart  
And play me a little shady grove  
Ring the bells of rhymney  
Till they ring inside my head forever  
Bounce the bow, rock the gallows  
For the hangman's reel  
And wake the devil from his dream  
I'm going back to Harlan  
I'm going back to Harlan  
I'm going back to Harlan

And I was Barbara Allen  
Or Fair Ellen all sad at the cabin door  
A-weepin' and a-pinin', for love  
A-weepin' and a-pinin', for love

So many men and girls are in each others arms  
It made me think we might be similarly occupied  
  
Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music  
Shall we fly  
Shall we dance  
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye  
Or per chance, when the last little star has left the sky  
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other  
And shall you be my new romance  
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen

whistled, stomped, stamped on the floor,  
yelling, screaming, begging for more,

Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing

Or it's the passing of the torch  
With one small voice it all begins  
Then there are millions more, millions more

Sun's up, mm, hmm, looks okay  
The world survives into another day  
And I'm thinking about eternity  
And this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
Yeah, I had another dream about lions at the door  
They weren't half as frightening as they were before  
I'm thinking about eternity  
Some kind of ecstasy's got a hold on me  
Walls windows trees, waves coming through  
You'll be into me and I'll be into you  
Together in eternity  
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Big orange flying boat rises off the lake  
Thousand-year-old dinosaur doing a double take  
Pointing a finger at eternity  
I'm sitting here in the middle of this ecstasy  
Last night again there where lions at the door  
But I wasn't frightened like I was before  
Thinking about eternity  
And the ecstasy that's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin'  
  
[Solo]  
  
Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay  
One of these days we're going to sail away  
Sail into eternity  
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where they are  
I wanna know

I snack between meals

I don't need to diet  
To prove I'm light  
And I don't peel the skin off of my chicken  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Deep fry  
Don't exercise  
And grow that middle age waistline  
  
It salivates my glands  
To smell a fresh roast ham  
So put out the butter and pass the rolls right over  
A second helping here  
A hefty mug of beer  
Let's get some dinner before the food gets colder

Middle age waistline oh yeah  
Not a crumb gets wasted

A boy flies for freedom  
But dies for the peace  
In the clouds, he waits for an answer  
But there's no release  
  
It's strange here without you  
And it's so hard to see  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
Oh brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
I still see his shadow  
His laugh lingers on  
When I dream, we're all back together  
When I wake, he's gone  
It's strange here without you  
This was not ment to be  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
And though we try to change the world  
A flower when it's cut will surely die  
So why do men with so much hate  
Destroy what they cannot create  
While we all stand by  
  
We will look back in anger  
But you helped us to see  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
Oh brother up in heaven

All along the shoreline  
There are footprints by the sea  
They head into the distance...  
Then they lead right back to me  
I made the break to freedom  
Now I'm following the dream  
You're never going to get here  
If you hold the old routine  
  
Now everything we possess  
That fills our empty lives  
Is only good for leaving far behind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we're going,  
Don't know why  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Call along the valley  
And you just may find us there  
I couldn't say for certain  
Cause we may be anywhere  
Head into the sunset  
Or just wander out to sea  
Wherever your heart leads you  
Is the place you're meant to be  
  
And someone who could be impressed  
With ordinary lies  
Could really use a little peace of mind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we'll go,  
But we'll get by  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Now everything we possess  
That fills our empty lives  
Is only good for leaving far behind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we're going,  
Don't know why  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again

""your baggage thank you sir""

God don't let it show  
  
I must control myself  
You must control me too  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
I'm scared to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down  
  
They say they'll care for me  
But I would rather be  
Both feet on the ground  
What if the engine dies  
These are no friendly skies'  
My head's spining round  
  
It's all a twist of fate  
But it's myself I hate  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
Afraid to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down

We say welcome to the mission  
Show us all what you can do  
We need a man with vision  
So we put our trust in you  
And now we hope sincerely  
That you'll do the best that you can do  
  
Oh for sure it won't be easy  
And we will have to risk our lives  
Some will try to break us  
And cut us down to size  
But jsut remember  
There can be no consolation prize  
Not in our eyes  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
Can you hear what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
Although time is getting short  
There's still some sand left in the glass  
And now we have a living breathing  
Rocket man at last  
It's time to take a step  
And nail our colours to the mast  
  
No more talk of great adventures  
When it's movement that we need  
It must be our intention  
That we never loose the lead  
So count us down to zero  
And let's get up to speed  
We're up and away  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
So believe what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
And so now they cry for justice  
As if justice will be done  
But the eye up in the sky  
Was flying to close to the sun  
The challenger has fallen  
And the race has now been run....

Been travelling this road for so long  
My eyes are tired but I carry on  
The sun lays down it's golden threads  
I need a place to rest my head  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
It's hard to be out here on my own  
So far away, so far from home  
I need to touch and feel your skin  
To live this dream in sleep again  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
So dream on, dream on  
Freedom comes with timeless sleep  
Dream on, dream on  
In the arms of night  
Your silent shadow gently speaks  
Dream on, dream on  
This hotel room's a lonely place  
It's a one night cell I must escape  
So I drink away my loneliness  
So I can sleep and dream again  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
And as I fall into  
The darkness of the night  
You come to rescue me to  
Shield me in your light  
I feel your touch  
The softness of your skin  
You hold me close before  
The day breaks in  
This dream's so true  
My heart it beats, it beats  
It beats for you, for you  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
So dream on, dream on  
Freedom comes with timeless sleep  
Dream on, dream on  
In the arms of night  
Your silent shadow gently speaks

Let's not fight it anymore  
Unpack the bags and close the door  
I'll never leave you, no no  
Though you lied right from the start  
I can't convince my stupid heart  
Not to believe you, no no  
You've got two good men strung out  
And there's not the slightest doubt  
That other men have loved you before  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
If I had one ounce of pride  
I'd stand up or step aside  
But girl love you (can't you tell it)  
So I'll accept the crumbs you drop  
'Cause I'm a fool and I can't stop  
Or rise above you, no no  
Let him speak up for himself  
I speak for me and no one else  
'Cause I'm a beggar knockin' on your door  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
I'm too far gone to turn around  
To lift myself up off the ground  
And start all over, over and over  
Now he or I must win or lose  
No matter which one you may choose  
You'll be in clover (you know you will)  
While you're makin' up your mind  
I'll be prayin all the time  
Prayin' that you'll never, never ever let me go  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
Till I can't take it anymore

I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time.  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been singing in the evening,  
Flying through the night.  
But I hurt my good guy,  
I hope he makes out right,  
Flying through the night.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
Been drinking down the rain.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
It makes me wonder when  
I'll see him again.  
You know time could bring a change, man,  
It ain't for me to say.  
You'll soon be out of range, man,  
This could only be the way  
It's meant to be.  
Fairy castle stark and black in the moonlight,  
The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion.  
Seagulls fly across my mind forever.  
Sadly goes the wind on it's way to hades.  
Would I, should I, could I be a stranger ?  
I shall walk right by and sigh good-bye.  
I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to blow my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been looking, you know I've been looking,  
You better believe I've been looking.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
I've been drinking down the rain.  
I've been thinking of the sunshine,  
I've been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
Blow my mind

Blow my mind ...

Like the morning sun  
His love moved across every inch of my body  
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire  
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure  
This morning when I opened my eyes  
There to my surprise  
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream  
And so I said a little prayer  
And thanked God, that he was there  
Oh, this is a dream come true  
Dream do come true  
I know 'cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But now I do  
Dreams do come true  
It was love at first sight  
And it was love all night  
And the way he made love to me  
Fulfilled all my fantasies  
Ooo, this is a dream come true  
Yes, dreams do come true  
I know 'cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But you're living proof  
That dreams do come true  
Dreams do come true  
And I am so in love with you

While all the women came and went  
Bare feet servants too

And the wind began to howl

Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back  
I'm sure that he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.

See him surface and never a shadow  
On the wind I feel his breath  
  
Goldeneye, I found his weakness  
Goldeneye, he'll do what I please  
Goldeneye, no time for sweetness  
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees

You'll never know how it feels to be the one who's left behind  
You'll never know the days and the nights, the tears, the tears I've cried  
But now my time has come and time, time is not on your side  
  
See him move through smoke and mirrors  
Feel his presence in the crowd  
Other girls they gather around him  
If I had him I wouldn't let him out

Golden chain take him to the spot  
Goldeneye, I'll show him forever  
It will take forever to see what I've got

Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone.  
  
(Tammy)  
Your lips are warm and tender  
Your arms hold me just right  
Sweet words of love you remember  
That the one at home forgot.  
  
(George)  
Each time we say it's the last time  
But we keep hangin' on  
(Both)  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone.  
  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone...

I never lost the love that I had given you  
With all the things that we have both been through  
I never stayed in love before  
As much as I have stayed in love with you  
You never thought the feelings meant for you were true  
'cause every time we're all alone you'd wonder  
If I really never changed  
And if I really stayed in love with you  
Love  
It means just you and me to stay together  
Even if there's nothing more  
The best is there forever  
Love  
We have to stay this way in love forever  
Even if you change your ways  
I'll always stay this way 'cause I  
I will always stay this way in love with you

His head turned and my heart jumped.  
When I saw that it was him.  
After two long years the love of my life.  
And I just held my breath in.  
Standin' there smiling.  
While his eyes locked on mine.  
He couldn't hear me screamin on the inside.  
  
CHORUS  
When I said, tear don't you fall.  
He's done let him go.  
Eye's don't look back.  
Down that empty road.  
And lips you may move.  
But don't you say too much.  
Oh and please, please heart hush.  
  
I said somethin' stupid.  
And reached out my hand.  
After makin' love and movin' earth. We were shakin' hands.  
A million sweet memoriers. Pinballed through my brain.  
The want to hold him one more time. Ran through my veins.

Then he stopped talkin' and kissed me tenderly.

I hold you in my arms  
There's a band playing  
What are those words whispered, baby  
Just as you turn away?  
  
Well I saw you last night  
Out on the edge of town  
I wanna read your mind and know just what I got in this  
New thing I found  
  
So tell me what I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
I heard someone call your name  
Underneath my willow  
I saw something tucked in shame  
Underneath your pillow  
  
Well I tried so hard, baby  
But I just can't see  
What a woman like you  
Is doing with me  
  
So tell me who I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
Now look at me, baby  
Struggling to do everything right  
And then it all falls apart  
When out go the lights  
  
I'm just a lonely pilgrim  
I walk this world in wealth  
I wanna know it's you I don't trust  
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself  
  
Now you play the lovin' woman  
I play the faithful man  
Just don't look too close  
Into the palm of my hand  
  
When we stood at the altar  
The gypsy swore our future looked right  
But in the wee, wee hours, maybe baby,  
The gypsy lied  
  
So when you look at me  
You better look hard and look twice  
Is that me, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
Tonight our bed is cold  
I'm lost in the darkness of our love  
God have mercy on a man  
Who doubts what he's sure of

Tonight my bag is packed  
Tommorrow I'll walk these tracks  
That will lead me across the border  
Tommorrow my love and I  
Will sleep 'neath auburn skies  
Somewhere across the border  
  
We'll leave behind my dear  
The pain and sadness we found here  
And we'll drink from the Brazos muddy waters  
Where the sky grows gray and wide  
We'll meet on the other side  
There across the border  
  
For me you'll build a house  
High up on a grassy hill  
Somewhere across the border  
Where pain and memory  
Pain and memory have been stilled  
There across the border  
  
And sweet blossoms fill the air  
Pastures of gold and green  
Roll down into cool clear waters  
And in your arms 'neath the open skies  
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes  
There across the border  
  
Tonight we'll sing the songs  
I'll dream of you my Corazon  
And tommorrow my heart will be strong  
And may the saints blessing and grace  
Carry me safely into your arms  
There across the border  
  
For what are we  
Without hope in our hearts  
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters  
And eat the fruit from the vine  
I know love and fortune will be mine  
Somewhere across the border

Emmylou Harris,My Father's House,/e/emmylou+harris/my+fathers+house_20050226.html,"(Bruce Springsteen)  
Last night I dreamed that I was a child  
Out where the pines grow wild and tall  
I was trying to make it home through the forest  
Before the darkness falls  
I heard the wind rustling through the trees  
And ghostly voices rose from the fields  
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path  
With the devil snappin' at my heels  
I broke through the trees, and there in the night  
My father's house stood shining hard and bright  
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms  
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms  
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart  
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts  
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride  
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light  
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch  
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door  
I told her my story, and who I'd come for  
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore""  
My father's house shines hard and bright  
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night  
Calling and calling, so cold and alone  
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned

No-one could ever come above  
She had me going crazy  
Oh I star-struck  
She woke me up daily  
Don't need no Starbucks  
She make my heart pound  
I skip a beat when  
I see her in the street and  
At school on the playground  
But I really wanna  
See her on the weekend  
She knows she got me dazing  
Cuz she was so amazing  
And now my heart is breaking  
But I just keep on saying  
  
(Justin)  
Baby, baby, baby oooh  
Like baby, baby, baby noo  
Like baby, baby, baby oooh  
I thought you'd always be mine

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday  
I've got a lot of things to learn  
Said I would and I believe in one day  
Before my heart starts to burn.  
So what's the matter with you  
Sing me something new  
Don't you know  
The cold and wind and rain don't know  
They only seem to come and go, away  
Times are hard when things have got no meaning  
I've found a key upon the floor  
Maybe you and I will not believe in the things we find behind the door  
Stand By Me  
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be  
If you're leaving will you take me with you  
I'm tired of talking on my phone  
But there is one thing I can never give you  
My heart will never be your home

Is it getting better  
Or do you feel the same  
Will it make it easier on you  
Now you got someone to blame  
You say  
One love, one life  
When it's one need  
In the night  
It's one love  
We get to share it  
It leaves you baby  
If you don't care for it  
Did I disappoint you  
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth  
You act like you never had love  
And you want me to go without  
Well it's too late  
Tonight  
To drag the past out  
Into the light  
We're one  
But we're not the same  
We get to carry each other  
Carry each other  
One  
Have you come here for forgiveness  
Have you come to raise the dead  
Have you come here to play Jesus  
To the lepers in your head  
Did I ask too much  
More than a lot  
You gave me nothing  
Now it's all I got  
We're one  
But we're not the same  
We hurt each other  
Then we do it again  
You say  
Love is a temple  
Love a higher law  
Love is a temple  
Love the higher law  
You ask me to enter  
But then you make me crawl  
And I can't be holding on  
To what you got  
When all you got is hurt  
One love  
One blood  
One life  
You got to do what you should  
One life  
With each other  
Sisters, Brothers  
One life but we're not the same  
We get to carry each other  
Carry each other  
One

The heart is a bloom  
Shoots up through the stony ground  
There's no room  
No space to rent in this town  
You're out of luck  
And the reason that you had to care  
The traffic is stuck  
And you're not moving anywhere  
You thought you'd found a friend  
To take you out of this place  
Someone you could lend a hand  
In return for grace  
It's a beautiful day  
Sky falls, you feel like  
It's a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
You're on the road  
But you've got no destination  
You're in the mud  
In the maze of her imagination  
You love this town  
Even if that doesn't ring true  
You've been all over  
And it's been all over you  
It's a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
It's a beautiful day  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Teach me  
I know I'm not a hopeless case  
See the world in green and blue  
See China right in front of you  
See the canyons broken by cloud  
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out  
See the Bedouin fires at night  
See the oil fields at first light  
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth  
After the flood all the colours came out  
It was a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
Beautiful day  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Reach me  
I know I'm not a hopeless case  
What you don't have you don't need it now  
What you don't know you can feel it somehow  
What you don't have you don't need it now  
Don't need it now  
Was a beautiful day

Look at you baby  
The picture of a broken man  
Your confidence is shaken  
The world caved in on you again  
But I know what to do to ease the pain  
And bring you back to life again

A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Is really all you need  
When life gets tough you need  
A little bit of love sometimes  
  
Oh baby hold me  
Let all that anger disappear  
A little smile is showing  
Something's catching fire here  
And when the morning comes you'll be good as new  
You'll take this night that we've shared with you

A little bit of love

A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Is stronger than anything  
Words ain't enough you need  
A little bit of love sometimes  
  
[Bridge:] You've done it before, you'll do it again  
Get up off the floor, and jump right back in  
Baby, I still believe in you  
And we'll see this through  
'Cause true love is on our side

A little bit, a little bit

A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes

You walk all over anyone who dares to be a friend,  
Screen and yell because you deem them unenlightened,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps.  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days  
I nearly broke my back as I was handing back for you,  
Half the time was hell and half a waste of time,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps.  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days.  
I do not know the answer to the universe I fear,  
So drown me cold and go and find your perfect man my,  
Dear,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps,  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days.

I can hear the sadness that your smile belies  
Thought I heard a whisper  
Did it come from you  
If you say you're ready  
I am ready too  
I will touch you deep inside where love is  
I will touch your sorrow and make it go away  
I can hear the questions running through your mind  
I can feel the answers very close behind  
When your heart is ready  
You will understand  
When you're tired of crying  
You will take my hand  
I will touch you deep inside where love is  
I will touch your sorrow and make it go away

No rapper can rap quite like I can  
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand

Make you say, ""Go L.L. and do the wop""  
  
If you think you can out rhyme me, yeah boy I bet  
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet  
Trendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good  
I got a gourmet plate that says I wish you would  
  
And when rap begin then I gotta join in and  
Before my rhyme is over you know I'm a win  
Cool J has arrived so you better make way  
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play!  
  
Sparring competition that's my hobby and job

MC's can't win I make 'em rust like tin  
They call me Jaws my hat is like a shark's fin  
Because I'm bad as can be got my voice all waxed  
Some brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed  
  
I couldn't shouldn't and it'll stay that way

Kamikaze take a look at what I've done  
Used to rock in my basement now I'm number one  
  
And can happen on time never standin' on lime  
You want to try me first you better learn how to rhyme  
I'm the pinnacle that means I reign supreme  
And I'm notorious I'll crush you like a jelly bean

You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk

I'm as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull  
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full  
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I  
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's withstand I tie  
  
Never retire or put my mike on the shelf  
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself  
Not bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad  
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad  
  
MC's they retreat cause they know I can beat 'em  
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em

And though we know each other better when we explore

That I never knew some of those secrets of yours

Now you were lying in the sun  
Wanting and needing no-one

She drank a pint of your rum  
And later when you told me  
You aid she was a bore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish  
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours  
  
In the name of honesty, in the name of what is fair  
You always answer my questions  
But they don't always answer my prayers  
And though I know you say that it's me that you adore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish

All the creatures small and large  
If you crumble I won't be living

Mountain, oh mighty mountain  
Show me secrets you have  
So I may become brother to Moses  
And live, live and be glad

Growing lighter in the dark  
If you crumble I won't be living

Who has seen martyrs among my brothers  
Yet strength remained in me to write the song  
Say no more! The children already know  
And their dreams grow strong like the trees  
In their minds where thoughts are plotted  
Is also where crystal suns are forged  
  
And they will be older than a thousand years  
So that they may open the deserts of the heart  
And in these dreams of the mountain  
Friendship will surface

If you love her  
And she makes one mistake,  
Please don't leave her  
It would make your heart ache.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
If you need her  
But you're letting her go,  
Please don't do it  
You'll be sorry, I know.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
Truly,  
She's caused you to doubt her,  
Truly,  
She's broken the rules.  
But life's not worth living without her,  
So listen to the wisdom of a fool.  
  
Think it over  
And forgive her this time,  
I was foolish  
I lost the love that was mine.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.

If you believe  
Within your heart  
You'll know that no one can change  
The path that you must go  
Believe what you feel  
And know you're right because  
The time will come around  
When you'll say it's yours  
  
Believe that you can go home  
Believe you can float on air  
Then click your heels three times  
If you believe  
Then you'll be there  
That's why i want you to  
Believe in yourself  
Right from the start  
Believe in the magic  
Right there in your heart  
Go ahead believe all these things  
Not because i told you to  
But believe in yourself  
If you believe in yourself  
Just believe in yourself  
As i believe in you

Say what you wanna  
But I'm here to stay  
'cause I'm a mean ole lion  
You can go where you're gonna  
But don't get in my way  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
You'll be standing in a draft  
If you don't hear me laugh  
And if you happen to come around  
Well, you best not make me frown  
For I just might knock you down  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
You know I'm ready to fight  
And turn your day into night  
'cause I'm a mean ole lion  
If you're half bright  
You'll detour to the right  
From a mean ole lion  
  
All you strangers better beware  
This is the king of the jungle here  
And if I happen to let you slide  
Don't just stand here  
Run and hide  
You just caught my better side

Madonna,And The Money Kept Rolling In,/m/madonna/and+the+money+kept+rolling+in_10172455.html,"(che:)  
And the money kept rolling in from every side  
Eva's pretty hands reached out and they reached wide  
Now you may feel it should have been a voluntary cause  
But that's not the point my friends  
When the money keeps rolling in, you don't ask how  
Think of all the people guaranteed a good time now  
Eva's called the hungry to her, open up the doors  
Never been a fund like the foundation eva peron  
  
Chorus:  
  
(workers:)  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
  
Rollin' on in, rollin' on in  
Rollin' on in, rollin' on in  
On in  
  
(che:)  
Would you like to try a college education?  
Own your landlord's house, take the family on vacation?  
Eva and her blessed fund can make your dreams come true  
Here's all you have to do my friends  
Write your name and your dream on a card or a pad or a ticket  
Throw it high in the air and should our lady pick it  
She will change your way of life for a week or even two  
Name me anyone who cares as much as eva peron  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
On out  
  
(che:)  
And the money kept rolling out in all directions  
To the poor, to the weak, to the destitute of all complexions  
Now cynics claim a little of the cash has gone astray  
But that's not the point my friends  
When the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books  
You can tell you've done well by the happy grateful looks  
Accountants only slow things down, figures get in the way  
Never been a lady loved as much as eva peron  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
On out  
  
(che:)  
Eva!!!  
When the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books  
You can tell you've done well by the happy grateful looks  
Accountants only slow things down, figures get in the way  
Never been a lady loved as much as eva peron  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
On out

Madonna,Goodnight And Thank You,/m/madonna/goodnight+thank+you_20087004.html,"(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Huevo  
She is in every magazine  
Been photographed, seen, she is known  
We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed  
If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring  
But she won't always answer the phone  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
But we have pretended enough  
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves  
  
(Che:)  
Which means...  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Che and Eva:)  
There is no one, no one at all  
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female  
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on  
Tricks they can try on their partner  
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them  
Support them, promote them  
Don't blame them, you're the same  
  
(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Emilio  
You've completed your task  
What more can we ask of you now?  
Please sign the book on the way out the door  
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call  
But I don't think that's likely somehow  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
But when we were hot, we were hot  
I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared  
Which means ...  
  
[Chorus] (substituting ""blame her"" for ""blame  
Them"", sung only by Che)  
  
(Eva:)  
There is no soap, no soap like Zaz  
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower  
It's the mother and father of luxury lather  
The talk of the bath, the great ointment  
One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic  
You're scented, you'll be sent  
  
(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon  
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio  
We'll think of you every time she's on the air  
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way  
So do up your trousers and go  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
The decline into silence and doubt  
Our passion was just too intense to survive  
  
(Che:)  
Which means ...  
  
(Lovers:)  
This is a club I should never have joined  
Someone has made us look fools  
Argentine men call the sexual shots  
Someone has altered the rules  
  
(Eva:)  
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes  
Is all very well but every girl knows  
  
(Che:)  
She needs a man she can monopolize  
With fingers in dozens of different pies  
  
(Lovers:)

Madonna,Oh What A Circus,/m/madonna/oh+what+a+circus_20087017.html,"(Che:)  
Oh what a circus, oh what a show  
Argentina has gone to town  
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron  
We've all gone crazy  
Mourning all day and mourning all night  
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right  
  
Oh what an exit, that's how to go  
When they're ringing your curtain down  
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron  
It's quite a sunset  
And good for the country in a roundabout way  
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today  
  
But who is this Santa Evita?  
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?  
What kind of goddess has lived among us?  
How will we ever get by without her?  
  
She had her moments, she had some style  
The best show in town was the crowd  
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""  
But that's all gone now  
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears  
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years  
  
(Crowd:)  
Salve regina mater misericordiae  
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra  
Salve salve regina  
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva  
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes  
O clemens o pia  
  
(Che:)  
You let down your people Evita  
You were supposed to have been immortal  
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for  
But in the end you could not deliver  
  
Sing you fools, but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long  
Your queen is dead, your king is through  
And she's not coming back to you  
  
Show business kept us all alive  
Since seventeen October 1945  
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin  
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in  
  
Instead of government we had a stage  
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage  
Instead of help we were given a crowd  
She didn't say much, but she said it loud  
  
Sing you fools, but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long  
Your queen is dead, your king is through  
She's not coming back to you  
  
(Crowd:)  
Salve regina mater misericordiae  
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra  
Salve salve regina Peron  
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva  
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes  
O clemens o pia  
  
(Eva:)  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
For I am ordinary, unimportant  
And undeserving of such attention  
Unless we all are, I think we all are  
So share my glory, so share my coffin  
So share my glory, so share my coffin  
  
(Che:)  
It's our funeral too

Hey (x54)  
  
(1st Verse- Violent J)  
Every year it's more of us and all we do is fill the box  
You might play with me at first, a couple days, a week at tops  
Just like your Atomic Supersonic Retro Plasma Car  
We will all get tossed inside just like the piece of shit we are  
I will be your fantasy imaginary special friend  
I can fill you ?? with you no need to talk to them  
But instead you toss me in the box, leave me to rott away  
Hoping you'll pick me again someday...hey, hey

Why don't you come play with me and take me to the other side[take me to the

Lost under Ann Raggedy it's lonely when your locked in side [It can be so  
lonley] (x2)

I will sit and listen to your bibble babble jibber talk  
But when you go in tonight you'll leave me out here on the walk  
You'll ignore your little friend or trade me for something instead  
Please come get your doggie, don't let him chew up my fucking leg  
All your mom and daddy do is work and fight, that's all they do!  
I can understand the way you feel because I feel it to  
But you'll leave me in the box and I can barley hear you play  
Lost umong the toys of yesterday, hey[hey]hey[hey]hey

Lord tell me why  
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier  
Ooh boy things will get brighter  
(Z-Ro)  
After living through drive-by's got a nigga ready for war  
500 push-ups everyday to keep my knock out punches up to par  
Cause everybody want to test me, knocking them down punching  
But they want to bust will I fight to jump so would the lord bless me  
To keep on breathing leaving niggas unconscience  
When I'm punching I'm going hard in the paint, so pack a lunch  
To the niggas that we killing don't feel like you the only motherfucker  
That really don't think we even love eachother  
Gorilla till I die for real murdered by my right hand man  
Or prosecuted by the white man's hand  
I don't think I'm living to die, but I'm dying to live up under the stress  
Fin to lose my cool so come out even to have you rest  
All my sins are forgiven for living violently  
With a gun in my hand, I'm creeping up on them moving silently  
They left my peope alone when my cutlass exploded on the side of the road  
The motherfuckers thought I died in the load  
(Chorus - 2x)  
(Z-Ro)  
Am I the hunter or the most hunted  
telling my people they don't need a high to get by  
But I'm telling a lie cause I'm the most blunted  
Hard to practice my preaching when I'm under the stress  
And I'm walking around with a 12-gauge sawed off  
and a suicide note up under my vest  
I want to live in peace but drama won't allow me  
That's why my mind is gone, I'm seeing x's and tylenol three  
But do you really want to see a nigga with the vendetta  
Make everybody kill somebody I'm a trend setter  
First I was spending my time with family mobbing showing my brother's love  
Never thought it would it happen to shoot first releasing my brother's blood,
uh  
Why do these rookies want to rumble, got to do him in  
Even if he's my kin that's the only way the cookies crumble  
Calling up on your name in vain, this time I took a bow  
But if there was ever a time I needed you god I need you now, lord oh mercy  
Cause I don't wanto to die by the hands of my own kind  
Really to get true to the overdose and free my own mind, hell yeah  
(Chorus - 2x)  
(Z-Ro)  
I no longer need the weed to reach another level, I'm on a natural high  
But I looked the devil in his eye, thinking the song I'm a survivor  
Things ain't what they seem my yellows are green  
People are demons, demons are people in my dreams, what does it mean  
I'm trying come out of this motherfucking nightmare  
Going against all odds but mama said they never fight fair  
Somebody put a price on my head for living dead  
Hoes was capping but now they in my bed, but they choosing to giving me head  
Rags to riches, sagging the creases in my breaches  
66 Impala candy dancing playing with he switches  
Finding away from righteousness and learning to sin  
You'd be the same nigga that's kicking the door with me that's turning me in  
Uh, why do the fiends buy dope from me they know they don't get high from me  
Why do the fiends buy dope from me knowing that they gone die from me  
A nigga was plexing with my partner why did he pull his gun  
Now everybody related or cool with you can die that's on my son

Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no  
  
I play my game of fantasy  
And I pretend that I'm not in reality  
I need the shelter of  
Your arms to comfort me  
  
No other sound is quite  
The same as your name  
No touch can do half as much  
To make me feel better  
So let's stay together  
  
I've got the memories  
To look back on and though  
They help me when you're gone  
I'm well aware, nothing can  
Take the place of your being there  
  
So glad we've got the real thing, baby  
So glad we've got the real thing, oh darling  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
  
Tell, tell me

And she said, they'll tag team  
Now who said dreams don't come true  
Its like I'm dreamin  
When I come through  
I always find something to run through  
Speak into the mike mami  
Mic check one two  
Drunk in the club  
Off the chain  
But who gives as fuck?  
That's why I came  
So pour it up  
And get down  
Ya'll have no choice  
But to listen to Pit now  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 2)  
Everybody knows  
Pit's got tight raps  
When I'm in the club  
DJs bring it back  
With no questions asked  
But the number one question is  
""Does he got cash?""  
Lil Jon's at the bar  
While me and them eastside boys smoke out  
Roll another one  
No doubt  
Get a couple hoes  
Roll out  
Beef, you don't want none  
To go down  
dumb diddy dumb dumb  
My times now  
The city I'm from  
Is covered with federals  
That'll make your crew run run  
Your crew run run  
Its next to come  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 3)  
I convince mami to creep on the DL  
Even though my head spinning  
Like some sprewells  
Skip the details  
Its the vodka bottom line  
that's testin my patience like doctors  
I'm not impressed by the cool shit  
Or those chains or that ice or them cars  
All that's bullshit  
If that's what your lookin for  
Keep lookin hoe  
Cause you got the wrong one bitch  
I'll let you know  
Mami's like damn  
That Cuban's shot out  
Bitch I came to the club  
To wild out  
If you came to act up  
Then you need to get from me bitch  
And back up  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)

Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
  
They say lightning, they say lightning  
Lightning never strikes twice in a row  
  
Generations, generations  
First they fight and then they forget  
What they were fighting about in the first place  
  
Here it comes, the big explosion  
Haven't I seen that once before  
Or is it just some deja vu  
Just some long forgotten dream  
Just some silly memory  
History does not repeat, it never, never does  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Bridge)  
I should know  
I've been hit three times (or was it four?)  
I'm a walking testimony  
Come here, look at these holes  
I'm a walking testimony  
Just look at these holes, look at these holes!  
  
Generations, generations  
Fathers never teach their sons  
And grandpa never talked to them and so on  
  
Memories are inconvenient  
When there's lessons to be learned  
That just might rock the boat too much  
Cause anxiety and such  
We cannot walk without our crutches  
We cannot walk, we cannot walk, we never, never could  
  
(Repeat Chorus and Bridge)  
  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?

Fucked her best friend, she sucked then you kissed her  
Fucked her best friend she sucked me then you kissed her

If she help me hit a lick, then I'm icing her out  
Down south, gold mouth, ya them birds fly south

Welcome to the Dark Carnival super show, you're our specialy invited guests

Cause you're the evilest pedophiles, rapists, and abusers  
All together we've got  
Fifty-thousand of you losers  
You're all about to witness an incredible sight  
Nobody's ever lived to tell about it  
And don't think you might  
It's about to rain flames,  
Frames, and brains  
To be blown into peices is the reason you came  
Racist bigots, wife beaters, judges, and cowards  
All crowded together expecting a show and some dollars  
But instead the shit you're gunna see  
You'll fear it in Hell  
It a constant explosion, see and feel it you shall

In the deserts of Nevada  
Where nothin else matta,  
It's the perfect place for you and your intestines to splatta  
And while Bang! Pow! Boom! steady stomps you all out  
You're in the hole for the nuclear fall out  
With the snakes and fakes creapy sneaks  
Hooks and crooks and horney freaks  
Shaddy ladies evil ernies richy richs and charlie cheaps  
Bang! Pow! Boom! they say the show is the bomb  
I heard it's strait up explosive, some even call it napalm  
Nobody battles back, this ain't no kinda war  
It's a one way execution, blow you strait to hell through the floor  
What the fuck you think you here for? sound the alarm  
Ladies and gentleman eat shit and die, let's bring I'm out  
  
(Chorus) (x1)  
  
The air is thick with sick demented brains and thoughts,  
But here they are all together, every one of them caught  
This is a celibration, in fact the carnival's cheering  
It's not too often Bang! Pow! Boom! makes an aperence  
And the winds in the sky will carry away all the ash  
But for now let us enjoy, the big bang blast!

Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here  
The Republics changed alot in a hundred years  
I don't think its working like you planned  
Mr Lincoln we sure could use a hand  
  
I just read the headlines in the Nashville News  
And I wish I made this up but I'm afraid its true  
Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street  
He was takin his wife to a nice place to eat  
When they caught the man he did 23 months of time  
He plead insanity like they do now all the time  
Sir what would you have done in 1859  
Now if you shoot someone sir you can get off scott free  
Its the latest thing mr Lincoln can you believe  
Now they sue the manufactures of the guns  
Aint the law changed alot since 1861  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I just heard the new story on the radio  
They let dangerous men outta prison now yes sir I'm afraid its so  
Because theyre overcrowded and it was only his fifth offense  
And this time hes killed someone does that make any sense  
Now my lawyer called me about a nuisance case  
Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days  
Well at least we're right all we gotta do is tell the truth  
  
He said youre living in the past you romantic fool  
I said you got that right I lean toward the older ways  
And theres damn few back woods lawyers left today

Did truly love the mademoiselle  
And now the young monsieur and madam  
Have rung the chapel bell  
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks

With a two room roebuck sale  
The coolerator was crammed  
With T. V. dinners and ginger ale  
But when pierre found work  
The little money comin' worked out well

Boy did they let it blast  
Seven hundred little records  
All rockin' rhythm and jazz  
But when the sun went down  
The rapid tempo of the music fell

Another summer in the neighborhood  
Hanging out with nothing to do  
Sometimes we go driving around  
In my sister's pinto  
Cruising with the windows rolled down  
We listen to the radio station  
We were too damn cool  
To buy the eight track tape  
There wasn't any good time  
To want to be inside

Surrounded by a casket  
That I built  
Out of warped woods and drift wood  
Rusted railroad spikes  
Collected from the neighborhood  
Skilled in the family trade  
I'm center stage  
In the most horrific side of me  
You'll ever see is like an instinct  
Some sort of nervous twitch  
I'll stack the bodies 10 high  
And bungee cord them to the trailer hitch  
Pulling dead weight  
Just made it over the border  
And out of state  
No time to debate  
Time is short and the day is only so long  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
[Chorus: X2]  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
(The moon is out and I'm digging on it) (x2)  
(Colton Grundy)  
Blaze Your Dead Homie  
The unliving I'm dead and lifeless  
The clock bearer  
So terror the time is  
Precise when your body is separating from soul  
That's where I take your life  
And transform you to a ghost  
And you're powerless  
Body limp, like dead fish  
Only choose 10, never more  
Less cause that be selfish  
No headstones  
Just 10 open holes in grounds  
And dead bodies surround me  
You're face down  
No garbage bags  
Not saying they trash  
I'm just saying it preserves the body  
And makes it last  
For the future  
And the time the to come ahead  
Take it from the dead man  
Things are easy when you're dead  
I'll be back for you  
I left the shovel right beside you  
I hid you pretty good  
I don't think no one's gonna find you  
Time is short and the sun's coming along  
I left the burial site before dawn  
[Chorus: X2]  
I left the burial site before dawn  
I left the burial site before dawn  
(The moon is out and I'm digging on it) (x2)  
(Colton Grundy)  
Am I the sand man?  
The one that freed you or your ghost  
Or the mad man?  
The one that slitining your throat  
Tonight's the night  
10 more coming to join you  
I'll make it interesting  
I would never disappoint you  
There's 30 of ya'll all  
Together and collected  
And this here, chunk of the Earth  
That we've infected  
And now you're expecting them to grow  
Into the millions  
Unless they find a way to capture, apprehend  
And kill me  
Unless they find a way to capture, apprehend and kill me  
Unless they find a way to capture, apprehend and kill me

And I live in a world  
Smaller than any one  
I got a line a new frontier

Are walking the streets of London  
So hysterical  
Nobody here gets a word that I say  
And the problems I'm told,  
Are more than medical  
I got a friend from the new frontier  
And Galen, she says,

And the word that you wanted was al-you-mi-ni-um

Here at the edge of the flat earth ending  
I'm getting off to get lost in the air

Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong

On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk

You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President  
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green  
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans

To analytical analogy, insurance policies why  
Said he know that sounds define the note  
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes

Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights

Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar

Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger

Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here  
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here

Mist upon the hill can remember murder,  
Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood,  
Helped to cover up an approaching army,  
Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men.  
  
Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping,  
Rolled up in their beds were children that play,  
Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them,  
None of them would see the dawn next day.  
  
Bloody were the blades that fell on children,  
Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name,  
The mountains only know all the souls that died there,  
Glen coe from that day can recall the shame.  
  
The quiet of the night never gave them warning,  
The silence of the hills wouldn't let them know,  
They'd never rise again on a mist filled morning,  
Never see the sunrise above glen coe.

The smile you gave me before the pain  
I could accept the world of darkness  
Never see the sun again...  
Never ever gonna leave ya,  
So dry your eyes and smile again  
Say the words I need to hear...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
Say that you need me,  
I can't take it anymore...  
But I know I must be strong,  
To keep belive in right or wrong...  
I've got time but I can't wait too long  
Wanna get you home where you belong...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
I can't take it anymore...

All you niggas get live and represent my click  
Got bits and pieces on my mind commin' together like lettuce  
Dear God protect us, cause we're mobbin' like Good Fellas  
Alias Carlion, maybe the war is on  
Prone to let my daughter live rich before she's grown  
If I murdered Capone, would you consider me a villain  
Chillin' with millionares, ex-killers, and set-trippers  
My murderous complex begin to hit 'cha  
Slip ya worse than New Jersey Drive niggas  
Cause I'm in a

Stepped of the plane, Mean Green and Tony Draper

Sick as leukemia for weed in my gansta' click  
Lets take riches

Bring your killa' chrome

She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
  
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
  
  
The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die  
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife  
  
  
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near  
She stood in the crowd but she'd not a tear  
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries on my bones

I knew from the first time I saw you  
I wanted you for myself  
You feel the same though it's got to be wrong  
We each belong to somebody else  
Once it was vague desire  
Now it's a raging fire  
Those things that people are saying  
Can't keep our love on the shelf  
How long can we talk about it  
What good is life without it  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night  
Love will make it right  
Four friends are driving on Sunday  
Our smiles a useless disguise  
By now they know what's inside our hearts  
My sweet, it shows in your eyes  
Through all the foolish laughter  
They know just what we're after  
How long can we keep on living  
This life of unspoken lies  
Some will be touched with sadness  
But how can we stop the madness  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night  
Love will make it right  
Some will be touched with sadness  
But how can we stop the madness  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night

I was right around the corner  
I know I could've said no, but I ain't stop  
Told me to Come in, the door is unlock for ya  
My intuition  
I should  
Have listened to it  
My girl  
Yo, she'd be pissed if she knew  
About this visit  
She had her tank top on, I took her tank top off  
I should've stopped  
Stop!  
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently  
She tempt me  
Right then I stopped thinking consequences  
Guess I must've lost my mind for a minute

Cause I did you wrong  
Now look at the damage  
Look at the damage that I've caused  
  
The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of  
A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love  
I gotta live with regret  
Deserve to get what you get  
Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying  
I rode past your house for hours  
Just to feel close to ya  
No car, no gift, no flowers  
Could get me back with you  
Your kiss, your touch  
Girl, you know I miss it  
But you got my heart  
Inside of a prison

In these streets  
Lost my girl  
Lost all that  
Wish I could  
Take it back

I was dippin'  
With these women  
In these streets  
Wish I could  
Take that back

Well I work the double shift  
In a bookstore on St. Clair  
While he pushed the burning ingots  
In Dofasco stinking air  
Where the truth bites and stings  
I remember just what we were  
As the noon bell rings for  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
Hold on to your aching heart  
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips  
A small town hero never dies  
He fades a bit and then he slips  
Down into the blast furnace  
In the heat of the open hearth  
And at the punch clock he remembers  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
I remember your leather boots  
Pointing up into the sky  
We fell down to our knees  
Over there where the grass grew high  
Love hunters in the night  
Our faces turned into the wind  
Blackhawk where are you know  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
We were Blackhawk where are you know  
We were Blackhawk where are you know  
Do you still have the ring I gave you  
On the banks of Lake Bear  
Where I felt certain that I knew you  
My cool and distant debonair  
Now we drink at Liberty Station  
Another cup of muscatel  
Wrapped in the strong arms of the Union  
Raisin' kids from raisin' hell

And stars of hollywood and Vine  
Too many goofs and ham-fisted moves and blaming it on the wine

Make it quick boys cause I ain't got long

Sure as anight on the moon shine, a recipe for leaving me slaughtered  
So beware of the smell and the lies they all tell

You cannot trust a blonde

It's a god awful small affair  
To the girl with the mousy hair  
But her mother is yelling no  
And her father has told her to go  
But her friend is nowhere to be seen  
As she walks through her sunken dream  
To the seat with the clearest view  
And she's hooked to the silver screen  
But the film is a saddening bore  
Cause she's lived it ten times or more  
She could spit at the eyes of fools  
As they ask her to focus on  
Sailors fighting in the dancehall  
Oh man, look at those cavemen go

Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy  
Wough man, wonder if he'll ever know

Is there life on Mars?

And Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow  
Now the workers have struck for fame  
Cause Lennon's on sale again  
See the mice in their million hordes  
From Ibiza to the Norfolk broades  
Rule Britannia is out of bounds to my mother  
My dog and clowns  
But the film is a saddening bore  
Cause I wrote it ten times before  
It's about to be writ again as I ask you to focus on  
Sailors...

Man you should have seen me way back then  
I could tell a tale, I could make a spin  
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night  
Not only that I could tell you why  
Back then I could really tel a lie  
  
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame  
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again  
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick  
I was takin' everything they had to give  
It wasn't all that bad a way to live  
  
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell  
But no one's buyin' what I got to sell  
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk  
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day  
But everyone just turns and walks away  
  
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time  
So I head across the road to drink some wine  
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street  
You're pretty good if I do say myself  
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else  
  
Instead of callin' out for fire from above  
He just gets real quiet and talks about love  
And I'll tell you somethin' funny He didn't want nobody's money  
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means  
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen  
  
Well since that time every town is the same  
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came  
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him  
He has everyone convinced that he's for real  
Well I figure we can work us out a deal  
  
So he offers me a job and I say fine  
He says I'll get paid off on down the line  
Well I guess I'll string along Don't see how too much can go wrong  
As long as he pays my way I guess I'll follow  
We're headed for Jerusalem tomorrow

So many times I've overflowed  
So many faces come and go  
I play my cards into the sun  
And try to work out  
What you are to me  
  
To me  
  
Been here before  
A million open doors  
Only one will set me free  
So I fall against the wall  
And try to work out  
What you are to me, to me, to me, to me...

Inside my eyes  
The answer lies  
Something I can't see

Squeeze,Maidstone,/s/squeeze/maidstone_20129161.html,"(deciphering the song we have yet to see.  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness  
The chilly winter nights bring the scarves from the drawer  
A crowd starts to gather on paving stone squares  
Teeth start to chatter as the staff leave the store  
And daughters meet mothers and fathers meet sons  
It's too dark to walk home without anyone  
The shopping precinct's closed, it's like a graveyard  
The chain falls through the spokes as I unlock my bike  
I cycle to the pub where I meet with my friends  
And I know that it's love as she pours me my pint  
And strangers meet strangers and friends share their lives  
I look at her again and feel butterflies  
I pull the pillow to my side  
And I imagine it is her  
As I slip into the night,  
I know what I prefer  
But I hope and I pray that one day she will say  
That's it's true  
I can't live without loving you  
Now there's no one around I push the bike home  
The rain's a lovely sound as it runs down the path  
There's our lights in the road, they amber the night  
And there's nobody home, so I soak in the bath  
And bubbles meet bubbles as they become one  
I think about the world and what I have done  
I pull the pillow to my side etc  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness (repeat to fade)

But something has happened

And the blues are at my door

And broken-hearted

Would it matter to you  
If we just took a walk  
To see where this path leads to  
Maybe stop in awhile  
Lay down, see you smile  
Looking up at those clouds in view  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
  
With the snow in your hair  
A crystal halo you wear  
While the chill winter air streams through  
Amid the birch and the oak  
Smell the fireplace smoke  
And the warmth we will go home to  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you

When it didn't work too well.  
I went down to see this gypsy woman, you understand,  
I told her my story, I told her what was goin' on.  
And she told me, man she said, all you need, all you need,  
She said all you got to have, oh lord,  
Just a touch of mojo's hand, oh bring it back on,  
And it feels pretty good, yes indeed.

At the moon in it's flight, my thoughts all stray to you  
  
In the still of the night, while the world is in slumber,  
Oh the times without number, Darling when I say to you,  
""Do you love me, as I love you?  
Are you my life to be, my dreams come true? ( Will you be my dream come true?)  
Or, will this dream of mine fade out of sight?""

It performs my daily functions  
Through a tube in my wien  
  
And today that thing malfunctioned  
Like a forest fire  
It burnt a hole in me and I perspired  
  
So there ain't gonna be a wedding  
No love affair  
No art to which none compares

Emmylou Harris,Coat Of Many Colors,/e/emmylou+harris/coat+of+many+colors_20050151.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
  
Back through the years I go wondering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my mamma put these rags to use  
  
There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall  
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love  
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of  
  
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read  
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said  
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me  
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch  
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes  
  
They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor only if they choose to be  
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me

She has seen and done it all

Dish it out or take it all  
Her heart's as soft as feathers  
Still she weathers stormy skies  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
A kaleidoscope of colors  
You can toss her around and round  
You can keep her in you vision  
But you'll never keep her down  
She's a lover, she's a mother  
She's a friend and she's a wife  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
Gentle as the sweet magnolia  
Strong as steel, her faith and pride  
She's an everlasting shoulder  
She's the leaning post of life  
She hurts deep and when she weeps  
She's just as fragile as a child  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken

To help me get on record

Dolly Parton,Could I Have Your Autograph,/d/dolly+parton/could+i+have+your+autograph_20041816.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
Hello, I don't know me from Adam, you don't know me from Eve  
I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely  
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe  
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Your name and your number on a small photograph  
I'd like to know you and what you're all about  
Hey could I have your autograph  
I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at  
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that  
You may not be famous but you look like a star  
You should be in movies as cute as you are  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Your name and your number on a small photograph  
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds  
And you're everything every girl dreams about  
And being with you would be heaven no doubt  
What I wouldn't do for your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
Hey could I have your autograph  
I like your body could I help you work it out  
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
You know you're just the kind to makes a woman real proud  
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South  
Could I have your autograph

He's a go getter, go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
Now I've got a neighbor that lives down the road a ways  
His wife holds down a steady job, he don't turn his hand all day  
I know that most of you will know the kind I'm talkin' about  
The kind that rather than have to work, he'd rather do without  
But he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
There's a group of men in the court house yard any time that you go by  
Playin' checkers and tradin' odds and makin' jokes about their wives  
They wait all week for pay day and they hold the money's plenty  
And the wife that's worked those long hard hours never gets a penny  
But he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
Yes he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
He's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her

I can't be true no matter what I do  
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you  
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I love you, I do, but I can't be true  
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye  
And I've fallen victim to many a smile  
I just love the excitement of love when it's new  
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you  
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true  
Some play it safe while some like it hot  
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop  
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got  
It might be different with you to know I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules  
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you  
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you  
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules  
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you

I cry awake at night and hug my pillow  
And pray that I will die before I wake  
No such luck  
Another day of cryin'  
Don't know how much more my old heart can break  
Flooded with these memories and emotions  
The tears like rain keep on falling down  
They say that I'll forget  
But my face is just as wet  
As it was the day you left this town  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
It's relentless and I'm defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
I can't believe that I can talk about it  
I never thought I'd live to see this day  
But a broken heart won't kill you  
You just want to die  
But you have to go on livin' anyway  
I feel it through and through  
And I've never been so blue  
And I cried a river over you  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
It's relentless and I'm defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless

Dolly Parton,Fish Out Of Water,/d/dolly+parton/fish+out+of+water_20041831.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
I feel so out of place here  
With this high society  
These high fallutin' people  
Don't know what to make of me  
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks  
A small fry in a big pan  
They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks  
Fish out of water  
I know I don't belong  
Fish out of water  
Everything I do is wrong  
My style of hair, the clothes I wear  
The way I speak, the things I eat  
The way I act, my lack of tact  
Nothin' seems to fit  
Fish out of water  
Flounderin' round  
Out of my element  
But I'm just as good as they are  
Why do I feel second rate  
It's like, ""Sorry Charlie,  
We want only tuna with good taste""  
I guess you could say Wal-Mart  
Is quite a way from Gucci's  
I'm Timex, they're Rolex  
I'm Captain D's, they're sushi  
Fish out of water  
I've had it to the gills  
Fish out of water  
With these yuppie-guppie frills  
Yeah, I'm a square in a round hole  
A catfish in a goldfish bowl  
A little fish with lots of soul  
Out of my element  
Fish out of water  
Flounderin' round just for the Halibut  
Save me, save me  
S.O.S. somebody  
Save me, save me  
Somebody rescue me  
Fish out of water  
Somebody throw me in  
Fish out of water  
On a scale of one to ten  
I'm a two, perhaps a three  
Compared to the big fish in the sea  
I'm washed ashore so save me please  
I'm in an awful fix  
Fish out of water  
Rescue me  
And you better do it quick  
Fish out of water  
It's such a culture shock  
Fish out of water  
My stomach's tied in knots  
Fish out of water  
Fish out of water

Dolly Parton,Green-eyed Boy,/d/dolly+parton/green+eyed+boy_20041738.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
I flew off to the wild blue yonder  
'Cause I had a dream  
And I had to go  
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder  
From the love I shared  
With a green-eyed boy  
Lips as sweet as mountain honey  
A body warm as home made wine  
But he had no dreams  
And no means for money  
But he had me just anytime  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Now he was pretty  
With chiseled features  
Like the movie stars in the magazines  
My first love and the son of a preacher  
I fantasized me was James Dean  
But the world outside kept pulling at me  
Offered me fame, respect, and gold  
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion  
Expensive cars, so I chose those  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss  
That green-eyed boy  
Do you think about me  
When the nights are long and cold  
Do you ever miss me  
Do you my green-eyed boy

Dolly Parton,Down From Dover,/d/dolly+parton/down+from+dover_20041822.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing  
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing  
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of
clover  
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover  
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground  
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown  
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over  
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home
place  
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face  
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her  
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down
from Dover  
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady  
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby  
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover  
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover  
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me  
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me  
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over  
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover  
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying  
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no
crying  
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold
her  
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
Down from Dover

I was lookin' for greener pastures  
When I left my old Kentucky home  
I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master  
So I left the one that loved me all along  
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better  
Didn't care about the grief I left behind  
Didn't even make a card or write a letter  
So sure I'd be successful in no time  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?  
How what you have is never good enough  
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder  
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up  
Well the seasons came, they went  
The dreams all shattered  
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown  
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered  
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind  
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'  
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin  
I'm heading for bluer pastures

In a dream I was walkin' in a beautiful field  
I was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill  
When a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land  
Jesus stood on the mountain and He held out His hand  
Then He came down from the mountain, headed down to the sea  
And the children strowed flowers in the path at His feet  
And He was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild  
Came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at His side  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love  
Ain't that a wonderful feelin', let us lift Him up  
Then He suddenly vanished from the crowd down below  
Reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow  
He said your questions are many but the answer is love  
I'll draw all men unto me if I be lifted up  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love  
There is life everlasting, let us lift Him up

In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky  
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day  
And I considered myself as lucky  
When he told me he would take me away  
And though he was older, it made me no difference  
His promise of riches was all I could see  
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky  
And know something better than sad poverty  
Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you  
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see  
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'  
But I'll always hold you in my memory  
But I've never adjusted to sociable livin'  
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me  
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky  
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me  
He won't let my family and friends come to visit  
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed  
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them  
All that's changed about me is my name  
Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you  
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore  
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy  
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before  
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky  
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win  
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me  
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again  
An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it  
It's my last request and he can't refuse me  
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky  
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me  
Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you  
But different from the way you remember me before  
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest  
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore  
I'll sleep in your arms forever more

Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady  
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady  
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady  
Lucky lady, that's what I was, I was lucky to have his love  
All a woman could wish for, he was that and so much more  
He was mine and how I loved him before your hands ever touched him  
Long before your temping eyes lured my baby from my life  
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady  
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady  
I was happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady  
Is it love or is it pleasure, do you know you've found a treasure  
Are you only having fun, do you know the prize you've won?  
If you don't want something lasting, if it's just the time you're passing  
Lucky lady, give him up 'cause I do love him very much  
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady  
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady  
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady  
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady

Many years you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times come again no more  
Oh hard times come again no more  
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away  
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake  
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend  
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen  
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more  
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for  
There's a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest  
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress  
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear  
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair  
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more  
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for  
There's a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare

Your mama can't give you what you're crying for  
There's a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
Hush a bye hard times go ye away  
I don't intend to be treated this way  
So, hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Don't cry no more  
Hush a bye hard times

Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters  
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more  
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters  
And there's no escape once they walk through that door  
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow, city of schemes  
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams  
Some, they go hungry and some go insane  
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains  
Some become users and some become used  
And some even make it, but most never do  
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow, city of schemes  
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams  
You spin them around like a merry-go-round  
You mold them and shape them and then throw them down  
All of your glitter and all of your gold  
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul  
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you  
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use  
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters

Dolly Parton,Daddy's Working Boots,/d/dolly+parton/daddys+working+boots_20180358.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
My dear hard workin' daddy works his life away for us  
That's the way that daddy shows to us his love  
And Daddy's two hard working hands  
They're callous and they're sore  
And Daddy's workin' boots have walked a million miles or more  
As long as I remember, I remember Daddy workin'  
Workin' on the job or either on the farm  
Tryin' to provide for the family that he loves  
And Daddy's working boots have taken many steps for us  
Chorus:  
Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation  
Though just like him, they're tired and worn  
For years they've helped him stand  
Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation  
They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man  
Dear lord above, I know up there my Daddy's got a mansion  
And a great reward that's long been overdue  
And when it comes my Daddy's time to be with you in heaven  
Spoken:  
Won't cha let him walk your golden streets  
In a pair of brand new golden boots  
Repeat Chorus  
Daddy's workin' boots

Dolly Parton,Evening Shade,/d/dolly+parton/evening+shade_20041829.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter  
Something badly needed to brighten up the chores  
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell  
In the water being used to scrub the floors  
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home  
She believed in lots of work with little play  
And we laughed till we bent double  
Though we knew we'd get in trouble  
But trouble's all we had at evening shade  
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding  
To teach you love and keep you off the streets  
And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem  
Juvenile delinquents so to speak  
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger  
An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate  
The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared  
But they cared even less at evening shade  
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed  
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death  
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this  
And so I started talking plans with the older kids  
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene  
And I would get some matches when nobody seen  
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside  
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye  
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day  
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway  
Now that its all over and the sun is going down  
There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground

Oh, you're out there tonight with another  
And my pain is so dreadfully sharp.  
I picture you with her and shudder,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Do you think that my feelings don't matter,  
Or your cheatin' or hurtful remarks  
When you leave me all broken and shattered  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'  
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, you cut me to pieces so often  
Like a knife or a poisonous dart  
I would be better off in my coffin,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'  
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Like a dagger through the heart, through the heart

Our love affair is bitter sweet  
Insecure and incomplete  
And I've often wondered why your leaving's been so long delayed  
It's all become so complicated  
Maybe you feel obligated  
And out of simpathy for me you stay  
But I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesn't love me  
And I'd rather have you go than stay  
And put me down a thinkin' you're above me  
Our love affair is so wound up  
It's best that we unwind  
And if you don't love me, leave me  
And don't let it trouble your mind  
You've waited much too long to leave afraid of how I'd take it  
And I'm deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it  
It won't be easy for a while but I'll forget in time  
And if you don't love me, leave me and don't let it trouble your mind  
I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesn't love me  
And I'd rather have you go than stay  
And put me down a-thinkin' you're above me

Sayin' so long to a love gone wrong and that's all she wrote  
Leavin' behind what once was mine with sad regrets

Walkin in the rain with a heart full of pain to the train depot  
The only things that's gonna keep me warm now is my overcoat  
Lost and lonely waitin in line at the ticket desk  
Hey mister won't you give me a one-way ticket on the Heartbreak Express  
I'm gonna roll on down the line  
I'm gonna go so far I'm gonna get it off my mind  
It hurts to know it ain't enough when you give your best  
Got a ticket to ride and I'm leavin tonight on the Heartbreak Express  
Oh I couldn't hold a candle to a flaming beauty that caught his eye  
It's killin' me now but I won't stay around and let him watch me die  
Oh it just goes to show you never do know 'cause I never would'a guessed  
I'd be sittin' here now on a train sorrow bound called the Heartbreak Express

And when I think I'm able to  
Well, I might try to be  
Your friend again  
But your restless heart  
And rovin' eyes  
My jealousy, these endless fights  
I've got to get out of your life  
Or I will never mend  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And I don't have the heart to  
Stay, and I can't take the pain  
I know we've tried to no avail  
Our heaven now has  
Turned to hell  
The same old hurt  
We know so well  
And something's got  
To change  
We both know it's got to end  
The passion's gone  
It's just pretend  
And one of us have got  
To make the move  
We might as well just give it up  
We've lost respect and  
There's no trust  
And without this, there's  
No real love  
It's just some sad excuse  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And there's nothing left but walk away  
Ain't this a crying shame  
A change of pace  
A change of heart  
A change of place  
A place to start  
And we'll be better off apart  
Our only chance is change  
And we never wil  
But something has to change  
But someday when I'm over you  
And when I think I'm able to  
Then I will try to be your friend again  
But I don't want to see  
Your face 'til then  
Change, I need a change  
I need a change  
We need a change

Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do  
He'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose  
What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool  
She swears she never knew but always needed to  
But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose  
Even love can't change the things he ought to change the most  
And it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees  
Makin' apologies but she loves him desperately  
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  
So he'd know all the perfect lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day  
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  
To sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"" are words that just don't come  
Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue  
But his eyes keep tellin' her ""you know I love you anyway  
No matter what I say or what I never say""  
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  
So he'd know all those fancy lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day  
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  
And sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
His ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer  
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
He's just a fool that must defend his honor  
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways

We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank  
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land  
And quenched our thirst with rain  
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet  
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me  
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back  
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack  
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need  
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me  
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch  
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit  
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul  
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know  
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride  
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life  
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery  
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me  
Well the winter came and the snow did fall  
And the night was cold and still  
And the rags we wore were not enough  
And Joe he caught the chill  
And he told me how he loved me  
And in my arms he went to sleep  
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me  
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge  
Lookin' down I see  
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me  
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me  
Tonight we'll be together again

Now I don't recall you said it  
But we'd lived so long on credit  
And so we headed out to find our promised land  
Just poor Appalachian farm folk  
With nothing more than high hopes  
We hitched our station wagon to a star  
But our dreams all fell in on us  
'Cause there was no land of promise  
And it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are  
Oh and these northern nights are dreary  
And my southern heart is weary  
I wonder how the old folks are back home  
But I'll keep leanin' on sweet Jesus  
I know He'll love and guide and lead us  
Appalachian memories keep me strong  
Ya know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately  
About what's been and what awaits me  
It takes all I've got to give what life demands  
You go insane if you give in to it  
Life's a mill and I've been through it  
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands  
Oh and these northern nights are dreary  
And my southern eyes are teary  
Don't I wonder how the old folks are back home  
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus  
I know he'll love and guide and lead us  
Appalachian memories keep me strong  
I'll keep lookin' to the Father  
Keep our heads above the water  
Appalachian memories keep me strong

He walked into the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool  
With a long soft southern drawl said I'll just have a glass of anything that's
cool  
A barroom girl with wise and knowing eyes slowly looked me up and down  
And she said I wonder how on earth that country bumpkin found his way to town  
And she said hello country bumpkin how's the frost out on the pumpkin  
I've seen some sights but man you're somethin'  
Where'd you come from country bumpkin  
  
Just a short year later in a bed of joy filled tears and death like pain  
Into this wondrous world of many wonders another wonder came  
That same woman's face was wrapped up in a raptured look of love and
tenderness  
As I marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy child feeding at her breast  
And she said hello country bumpkin fresh as frost out on the pumpkins  
I've seen some sights but babe you're somethin' mommy loves her country
bumpkin  
  
Forty years of hard work later in a simple quiet and peaceful country place  
The heavy hand of time had not erased the raptured wonder from my woman's face  
She was lying on her death bed knowing fully well her race was nearly run  
Byt she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son  
And I said so long country bumpkins the frost is gone now from the pumpkins  
I've seem some sights and life's been somethin' see you later country bumpkins  
See you later country bumpkins

Diamonds are forever,  
They are all I need to please me,  
They can stimulate and tease me,  
They won't leave in the night,  
I've no fear that they might desert me.  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
Hold one up and then caress it,  
Touch it, stroke it and undress it,  
I can see ev'ry part,  
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.  
I don't need love,  
For what good will love do me?  
Diamonds never lie to me,  
For when love's gone,  
They'll lustre on.  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
Sparkling round my little finger.  
Unlike men, the diamonds linger

My baby boy  
  
Just let it die  
With no goodbyes  
Details don't matter  
We both paid the price  
Tears in my eyes  
You know sometimes  
It'd be like that baby  
  
Now every time I see you  
I pretend I'm fine  
When I wanna reach out to you  
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride  
Baby I must confess  
We were bigger than anything  
Remember us at our best  
And don't forget about

Late nights, playin' in the dark  
And wakin' up inside my arms  
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and  
I can see it in your eyes  
You still want it  
So don't forget about us  
I'm just speaking from experience  
Nothing can compare to your first true love  
So I hope this will remind you  
When it's for real, it's forever  
So don't forget about us  
  
Oh they say  
That you're in a new relationship  
But we both know  
Nothing comes close to  
What we had, it perseveres  
That we both can't forget it  
How good we used to get it  
  
There's only one me and you  
And how we used to shine  
No matter what you go through  
We are one, that's a fact  
That you can't deny  
So baby we just can't let  
The fire pass us by  
Forever we'd both regret  
So don't forget about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if she's got your head all messed up now  
That's the trickery  
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be  
I bet she can't do like me  
She'll never be M-C

When it's for real, it's forever  
So don't forget about us.

Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.  
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,  
But as for me and grandpa we believe.  
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,  
And we begged her not to go.  
But she forgot her medication, and she  
Staggered out the door into the snow.  
When we found her Christmas morning,  
At the scene of the attack,  
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,  
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.  
  
Now we're all so proud of grandpa,  
He's been taking this so well.  
See him in there watching football,  
Drinking root beer and  
Playing cards with Cousin Mel.  
It's not Christmas without Grandma,  
All the family's dressed in black  
And we just can't help but wonder:  
Should we open up her gifts,  
Or send them back?  
Send them back!!  
  
Now the goose is on the table  
And the pudding made of fig  
And the blue and silver candles  
That would just have matched  
The hair on grandma's wig.  
I've warned all my  
Friends and neighbors  
Better watch out for yourselves,  
They should never give a license  
To a man who drives a sleigh  
And plays with elves

Push, pull, pressure, pleasing  
Beads of sweat drip down your neck,  
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak  
Trembling, trembling, trembling

Johnny Cash,Drink To Me,/j/johnny+cash/drink+to+me_20188853.html,"(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)  
A rose a carnation the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet  
But only the orchid was worthy of you so I threw all the others away  
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals and after a day or two  
The flower still blooms but it scents not the orchids it carries the savor of
you  
(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)  
  
So if you're gonna drink to me drink with your eyes and I'll never cry for
wine  
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine  
Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul and honey from a sugar
tree  
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe  
Honey come here and drink to me drink to me drink to me

Michael Bolton,Fool For Love,/m/michael+bolton/fool+for+love_20092523.html,"(duet with Johnny Hallyday-english version)  
  
(Johnny's part)  
I'm coming out with my hands up,  
Put down your guns and I'll... Confess.  
I loved her more than life itself,  
My angel in a pale blue dress.  
But if you want to shoot, then shoot,  
I'd welcome an eternal sleep.  
No man has ever felt a love,  
So deep.  
  
(Michael's part)  
I took her life, her tender life,  
I couldn't bear to think that she,  
Could laugh and love and give herself,  
To any other man than me.  
So if my world would end tonight,  
I will not cry... I do not care.  
I'll meet her in another life,  
Somewhere.  
  
Chorus:  
(Johnny and Michael)  
I was a fool, a fool for love,  
A fool who believed, that she came from above.  
I'll stay a fool, until I die,  
She was my world, my breath, my sky.  
I'm just a fool, who lost all control,  
Along with my soul.  
In time the fool, becomes a clown,  
And you all laugh, as I fall down.  
  
(Michael's part)  
I'll never be at peace again,  
I'll never feel her warm caress,  
I'll leave each day just thinking of,  
My angel in a pale blue dress.  
  
(Johnny's part)  
And when her body's in the ground,  
Make sure you save a space for me,  
For that's the only place, I long to be.

Alan Parsons Project,One Day To Fly,/a/alan+parsons+project/one+day+to+fly_20005358.html,"(elliott, english)  
  
Where does a dream belong  
Locked in the mind on the edge of time  
Like a ship lost in a storm  
How do we find the key  
Longing to see, through the artist's eye  
Maybe only birds can fly  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
One day to fly  
  
Someone said and I believe  
Try if you dare, you can walk on air  
A dream is all you need  
A circle that takes you high  
Lighter than air as the earth goes by  
Through a spiral in the sky  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
  
Just a charcoal sketch on canvas  
Made them laugh but now they see  
That the artist had a vision  
That the wind could set us free  
It's a bridge until tomarrow  
Taking us beyond the sun  
As the artist paints his picture  
The story's just begun  
  
Analyzing, criticizing  
Fear of the unknown  
Theorizing, visualizing  
The road to take us home  
If it takes forever  
Someone's gonna fly  
We may never get to heaven  
But still we're gonna try  
  
Watching the birds  
As they sail on the wind  
One day to fly

Layin' about, lying in bed  
Maybe it was somethin' I thought I said  
With the tempo of the damned, the temptation of tomorrow  
I don't know if I can give you anything but sorrow  
  
They stay alive this late on Radio Five  
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth  
But the moments that I care about are moments that I treasure  
Better take another measure for pleasure  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
I count the pages of the letter I write  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  
Tearin' up the sheets of love this hand could not disguise  
I'll start to count again and close my eyes  
  
Losing you

Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me

Can be this easy for me and you

My personal revenge will be the right  
Of our children in the schools and in the gardens  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
This song which has flourished without panic  
My personal revenge will be to show you  
The kindness in the eyes of my people  
Who have always fought relentlessly in battle  
And been generous and firm in victory  
My personal revenge will be to tell you good morning  
On a street without beggars or homeless  
When instead of jailing you I suggest  
You shake away the sadness there that blinds you  
And when you who have applied your hands in torture  
Are unable to look up at what surrounds you  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
These hands that once you so mistreated  
But have failed to take away their tenderness  
It was the people who hated you the most  
When rage became the language of their song  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Its heart has been scarred forevermore  
It was the people who hated you the most  
When rage became the language of their song  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Its heart has been scarred forevermore  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Red and black, it's heart's been scarred  
Forevermore

Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion

Crystal words across the sky

She's the mistress of all time  
Her sun pours down like liquid gold  
To chase away the sorrows  
Her clothes are like a million stars  
Made of tears and rainbows  
And all the while  
Her senses smile into my life

Just like the restless  
To a mission bell

Meet her everywhere  
As her music fills the universe  
She leaves the dancing visions  
Of her image on the water  
And precious stones upon the shore  
From every distant corner  
Like diamonds in the light  
They shine beyond the stars

Long ago a homie told me, yo that crime pays  
No I'm in the hot pursuit, I'm riding sideways  
I know my life ain't worth the bullets in your '45  
But you ain't hitting me, I jump into a sporty dive  
Before you know I got my shank inside your throat and sides  
24's on 84 Regal as you was flooring right  
Pilling, chrome creeping, through the ghetto zone  
9 milli-milli bang for the metal tome  
Send you back to your mama wrapped in cello-phone  
You seen the lights of the flashy berretta chrome  
Slice your ass with this hatchet like we Tom and Jerry  
Knock your shit out, get you paid by the tooth fairy  
When you die you're getting wet up like your bloody Carrie  
Tuck your ass nice and cozy for the cemetery  
When I burry your ass

Madonna,Don't Cry For Me Argentina,/m/madonna/dont+cry+for+me+argentina_10172462.html,"(Eva:)  
It won't be easy, you'll think it strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love after all that I've done  
  
You won't believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressed up to the nines  
At sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen, I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun  
  
So I chose freedom  
Running around, trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune, and as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired  
  
They are illusions  
They are not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you and hope you love me  
  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have I said too much?  
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.  
But all you have to do is look at me to know  
That every word is true

I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire  
Or else, or else I could choose time  
  
Remember I was very young then  
And a year was forever and a day  
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?  
I saw the lights, and I was on my way  
  
And how I lived, how they shone  
But how soon the lights were gone  
  
(Che:)  
The choice was yours and noone else's  
You can cry for a body in despair  
Hang your head because she is no longer there  
To shine, to dazzle, or betray  
How she lived, how she shone  
But how soon the lights were gone  
  
(Embalmers:)  
Eyes, hair, face, image  
All must be preserved  
Still life displayed forever  
No less than she deserved.

Take me in at your flood, give me speed  
Give me lights, set me humming  
Shoot me up with your blood, wine me up  
With your nights, watch me coming  
All I want is a whole lot of excess  
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing  
  
Stand back, Buenos Aires

You will shine to the death, you are shoddy  
But you're flesh, you are meat  
You shall have every breath in my body  
Put me down for a lifetime of success  
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

All I want to know

Blue Monday how I hate Blue Monday  
Got to work like a slave all day  
Here come Tuesday, oh hard Tuesday  
I'm so tired got no time to play  
Here come Wednesday, I'm beat to my socks  
My gal calls, got to tell her that I'm out  
'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day  
And Friday I get my pay  
Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'  
All my tiredness has gone away  
Got my money and my honey  
And I'm out on the stand to play  
Sunday mornin' I'm feelin' bad  
But it's worth it for the time that I had  
But I've got to get my rest  
'Cause Monday is a mess

Baby when I met you there was peace unknown  
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside  
There was something going on  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain  
Every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
Tender love is blind  
It requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha  
  
I can't live without you if the love was gone  
Everything is nothing when you got no one  
And you walk in the night  
Slowly losing sight of the real thing  
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear  
This could be the year for the real thing  
No more will you cry  
Baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one  
In love forever  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha

And to other places aggra-  
Vate all our cares.  
We'll save our fares!

What is known as old Manhattan  
We'll settle down  
Right here in town!  
  
We'll have Manhattan  
The Bronx and Staten  
Island too.  
It's lovely going through  
The zoo!  
  
It's very fancy  
On old Delancy  
Street you know.  
The subway charms us so  
When balmy breezes blow  
To and fro.  
  
And tell me what street  
Compares with Mott Street  
In July?  
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by.  
  
The great big city's a wonderous toy  
Just made for a girl and boy.  
We'll turn Manhattan  
Into an isle of joy!  
  
We'll go to Yonkers  
Where true love conquers  
In the whiles  
And starve together dear, in Chiles  
  
We'll go to Coney  
And eat baloney on a roll  
In Central Park we'll stroll  
Where our first kiss we stole  
Soul to soul  
  
And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show they say  
We both may see it close, some day  
  
The city's glamour can never spoil  
The dreams of a boy and goil  
We'll turn Manhattan  
Into an isle of joy!

Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again

You sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again

Lay your head on my pillow

Dont you think its time we say  
Some things we havent said  
It aint too late to get back to that place  
Back to where, we thought it was before  
Why dont you look at me

The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,  
(Yeah nigga, what.)  
  
[Cee-lo, Chorus]  
  
Nigga what,  
From my voice I'm killing 'em,  
I she'd my blood,  
About everything I love,  
  
[Nas]  
The Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker,  
Pretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber,  
Heister, my own life biographer,  
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping,  
Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing,  
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers,  
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me,  
Draped in paisley bandanas,  
Suits with Adam Stacey,  
Cigar like dick Tracy,  
Its dark I get spacey,  
Alcohol and laced weed,  
That was part of my 80's,  
The Cartier consigieres be near me,  
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,  
Liz Taylor tried to joke me  
Coz I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be  
When he gets mean,  
Think fast before I blast hoes,  
Like Grassino,  
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion,  
And realest rappin',  
Pablo bath on the scene, won't go back to no green,  
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas,  
Two of New York's biggest niggaz,  
Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us,  
Nas and Diddy, power hustlers.  
(Yeah nigga, what.)  
  
[Cee-lo, Chorus]  
  
Nigga what,  
From my voice I'm killing 'em,  
I she'd my blood,  
About everything I love,  
  
(C'mon...)  
  
(On everythin' I love man...)

I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhymes  
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching  
Oh, but we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly  
Oh, but Darling can't you see that, there's no one more important to me  
Baby, baby, can't you see through me, 'cause we're alone now  
And I'm singing this song to you, you taught me precious secrets  
Of a true love withholding nothing, you came out in front  
When I was hiding, yeah, yeah, but now it's so much better  
If my words don't quite come together, please listen to the melody  
'Cause my love is in there somewhere hiding  
I love you in a place where there is no space or time, I love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine, and when my life is over  
Remember, remember, remember when we were together  
And we are alone now, and I was singing this song to you  
We were alone, and I was singing, yeah singing  
We were alone, and I was singing this song for you  
Singing my song, I'm singing my song for you

I hated the moonlight  
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling  
Seemed flat as the noonlight

Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men

Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for  
Someone I really could care for  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold

Come take a walk with me  
Let's pretend we're just two people and  
You're not better than me  
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly  
  
What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street  
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep  
What do you feel when you look in the mirror  
Are you proud  
  
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry  
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Can you even look me in the eye  
And tell me why  
  
Dear Mr. President  
Were you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
How can you say  
No child is left behind  
We're not dumb and we're not blind  
They're all sitting in your cells  
While you pave the road to hell  
  
What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away  
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay  
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say  
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine  
  
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry  
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Can you even look me in the eye  
  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Minimum wage with a baby on the way  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Building a bed out of a cardboard box  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Hard work  
Hard work  
You don't know nothing bout hard work  
Hard work  
Hard work  
Oh  
  
How do you sleep at night  
How do you walk with your head held high

I can feel you looking my way  
And my body is all alone here in the days, oh!  
You think you gonna take me home,  
You know I'm thinking it too  
It's on my mind!  
Cause I got... all I got...  
Don't look so amazing when I do it  
Why we're still wasting time, let's do it  
Get your car!  
  
Chorus:  
I'mma make your body love when you leave the club  
Oh, all I really want you to do is scream my name  
And nobody else... love me girl!  
Cause you got...  
  
Can you love,  
Yes I can love you!  
I want you!  
Baby I want you, too!  
Do you love me?  
I can love you  
Can you love? Yeah!  
Yes I do! Do you love me!  
Baby we can do it all night  
Till the morning like a rodeo  
And you read by my side,  
I got the glasses, I got the liquor,  
I got the... I'm about to switch her... !  
  
Chorus:  
I'mma make your body love when you leave the club  
Oh, all I really want you to do is scream my name

Dolly Parton,Both Sides Now,/d/dolly+parton/both+sides+now_20695154.html,"(feat. Judy Collins and Rhonda Vincent)  
  
Rows and floes of angel hair  
And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons ev'rywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain and snow on ev'ryone  
So many things I would have done  
But clouds got in my way  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way you feel  
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
  
But now it's just another show  
You leave 'em laughing when you go  
And if you care, don't let them know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From give and take, and still somehow  
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud  
To say ""I love you"" right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds  
I've looked at life that way  
  
But now old friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads, they say I've changed  
Well something's lost, but something's gained  
In living ev'ry day  
  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all

Ya dig, Santana  
Weezy F.  
Ay Wayne  
What up man  
What you been workin' on nigga?  
Oh you know, I got Currency's new album  
And I'm finally workin' on my album, ya dig  
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga  
That's what it is  
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together  
That's that ""I Can't Feel My Face Shit"" they know what  
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide  
Guess what, we already did  
  
[Juelz Santana]  
I'm feelin' like a black Republican  
Naw, I can't call it  
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office  
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it  
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya  
I protect my land like a farmer  
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara  
Or should I say fat like the Parkers  
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra  
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered  
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers  
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness  
Rock star, flier than an ostrich  
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass  
I shall shine forever, never tarnish  
Money buried behind my house like a garden  
All green, my bank account's like a forest  
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started  
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig  
A black activist like Sonny Carson  
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me  
And chicks, I get 'em high  
Higher than turbulence is  
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious  
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims  
It's get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim  
Ai!  
Now all y'all listen  
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen  
  
[Lil Wayne]  
I feel like a black Republican  
Tote a mac in the public and  
Act so southern n' die for my brethren  
Money, money, money  
Like money Mac and publishing  
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan  
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covered in em  
Been done had cake day late like Ed Sullivan  
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan  
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them  
And my mind is on another continent  
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit  
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politick  
Bet I get all in her mouth like polident  
New Orleans representa to the inner  
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer  
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep  
Wake a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be  
  
[Santana]  
  
I'm feelin like a black republican drug money comin in  
I'm a volcano filled with lava bout to erupt again  
I stay with the iron don't make me plug it in  
Stay outta rich kid's business don't be buttin in  
I stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it  
Forget her tongue she put her lung on it ha  
My listerine comes out she start guzzerin  
I'm above you dudes I'm hoverin  
Juelz why you duckin them duckin who?  
I'm in the hood like what it do comfortable  
And believe me it's nothin to  
Send my london boys to english muffin you  
You poodles barkin too much they bringin muzzles through  
You aint gully you gullible  
Man they need love, they need hugs,  
They need church, Jesus  
This is jus a sample yea a free drug  
The shipment is in, we done re-d up  
But I don't trust dudes like a pre-nup  
They cockaroaches, they gotta be bug  
Maybe cause they them  
And we us and we up  
I'm ballin fareal ya gotta d-up  
I don't hear you boys speak up  
What are you guys sayin [?]  
I have the chaufeur hold the umbrella over my head when it's not rainin

And we wanna let the world know  
This is not a diss song either people  
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig  
Recognize or step aside, ya dig

See Life Is But A Dream  
So Is Love And I Believe  
If You Ever Been In Love  
You Would Know What I Mean  
Yea, So Lord Help Me Please

She Keep Telling Me I'm Wrong

Josh Groban,Weeping,/j/josh+groban/weeping_20356943.html,"(Feat. Ladysmith Black Mambazo)  
  
I knew a man who lived in fear  
It was huge, it was angry,  
It was drawing near.  
Behind his house a secret place  
Was the shadow of the demon  
He could never face.  
  
He built a wall of steel and flame  
And men with guns to keep it tame  
Then standing back he made it plain  
That the nightmare would never ever rise again  
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain.  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
He tells the world that it's sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
It's lonely sound  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.  
  
And then one day the neighbors came  
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame  
They stood around outside the wall  
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all  
""My friends,"" he said, ""We've reached our goal  
The threat is under firm control  
As long as peace and order reign  
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain  
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain. ""  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
He tells the world that it's sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
It's lonely sound  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.  
  
Say ah, say ah, say ah  
Say ah, say ah, say ah  
  
[Ladysmith's solo]  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
He tells the world that it's sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
It's lonely sound  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.  
  
Say ah, say ah, say ah  
Say ah, say ah, say ah [to end]

Way before Nas, I had my first menage  
Way before T. I., I taught him how to be fly  
Way before Nelly, I was up in the telly

Before Lil' Jon, I put the south on  
Before Ludacris, Ya boy was doin this  
Before Snoop Dogg, I put rappers in the morgue

Before Wu Tang, I was the new thang  
I whispered on shorty ear before Ying Yang  
Before Mobb Deep, I had 'em shook over the beat  
Years before Busta, I had my first customer

But I can't talk to greasy

Ya man Elle El couldn't go outside  
When ya boy Melle Mel had the pimped out ride  
Way before me, Kurtis Blow stacked dough  
He ruled the world, I was in the front row  
Run-D. M. C. Showed me what I wanna be  
I got kicked out the studio by Kool Moe Dee  
The Cold Crush Four and the Treacherous Three  
Ain't give a damn about a snotty nose kid like me

I hit 'em on the jack, them niggas never called back

Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow
groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me
and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for
you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done
gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.  
  
[Bridge:]  
She loves me, she loves me not.  
  
[Verse 1: Little Brother]  
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.  
You wanted the role, smash the audition.  
Havin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.  
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.  
And some say it's the life I was given.  
I say it don't matter if I work at Mc-E-D's.  
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.  
On a new broad, you still one to one.  
Every once in again I like havin' some fun.  
No disrespect intended but what's done is done.  
Women steppin' out for love, men do what to come.  
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.  
The last thought I get is Koobie run.  
To them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.  
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.  
  
[Chorus x2: Lil Brother First, Lil Wayne Second]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Verse 2: Lil Brother]  
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.  
Every morning, and every evening.  
Ten years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.  
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.  
In the nfl which mean Not For Long.  
City to city, all the groupies they hop along.  
Word get back to wifey, she like ""Stop the song,""  
I'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone.  
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears.  
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years.  
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating.  
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings.  
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids.  
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is.  
I ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price.  
Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life.  
And he gon' live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound
like a broken record.  
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs.  
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]  
I say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you.  
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo.  
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo.  
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo.  
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices.  
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces.  
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta.  
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger.  
And I know cheaters never get crowned.  
So I play ""fair"" like roller coasters and clowns.  
You gotta hold ya soldier down.  
Even when the war is lookin' it is right around the corner.  
And you don't want to leave me, believe me.  
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv.  
It's young weezy, I know what ya thought.  
But I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Chorus x2: Lil Wayne First, Lil Brother Second]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.

Patsy Cline,Daddy's Hands,/p/patsy+cline/daddys+hands_20694852.html,"(feat. Loretta Lynn)  
  
I remember daddy's hands folded silently in prayer  
And reachin' out to hold me, when I had a nightmare  
You could read quite a story in the callous' and lines  
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind  
  
Verse 2  
I remember daddy's hands how they held my mama tight  
And patted my back for something done right  
There are things that I'd forgotten that I loved about the man  
But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands  
  
Chorus  
Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'  
Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong  
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle but I've come to understand  
There was always love in daddy's hands.  
  
Verse 3  
I remember daddy's hands workin' 'til they bled  
Sacrifised unselfishly just to keep us all fed  
If I could do things over, I'd live my life again  
And never take for granted the love in daddy's hands  
  
Repeat chorus

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out  
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out  
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out  
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out  
Breathe in, breathe out  
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out  
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out  
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""  
[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap  
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)  
But is it cool to rap about gold  
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)  
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack  
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack  
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant  
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again  
And it's still about the Benjamins  
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms  
Strippers named Cinnamon  
More chips than Pentium  
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is  
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks  
And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""  
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?  
What the hell was wrong with me dog?  
Sing along with my y'all

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave  
But its one life to live, that's why I'm gettin paid  
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised  
Spit like I need a raise  
Blaze as I gaze, at the stars and ask the lord  
Why the culprit at the pall pit  
It make me sick to my stomach  
That's why I rap, like a pregnant woman I don't spit I vomit  
So pay homage me and wayne two G's  
Like twenty hundreds  
And we keep the semi's blunted  
And we live like brothas from anotha  
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something  
That's a hint to you David  
Throwin shots at Goliath  
This the new testament, where the victor is tha giant  
So you should get your way and lose the hate  
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a females trait

A million miles our vagabond heels  
Clocked up beneath the clouds  
They're counting down to show time  
When we do it for real with the crowds  
Air miles are owing  
But they don't come for free  
And they don't give you any for pain  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
The rimshots come down like cannon fire  
And thunder off the wall  
There's a man in every corner  
And each one is giving his all  
  
This is my fife  
This is my drum  
So you never will hear me complain  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning  
  
Well if you're inclined  
To go up on the wall  
It can only be fast and high  
And those who don't like the danger  
Soon find something different to try  
When there's only a ringin' in your ears  
And an echo down memory lane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
  
The show's packing up  
I sit and watch the convoy  
Leaving town  
There's no pretending I'm not a fool,  
For riding around and around  
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death  
You showed me one time on the plane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
A million miles of vagabond sky  
Clocked up above the clouds  
I'm still your man for the roaming  
For as long as there's roamin' allowed  
  
There'll be a rider  
And there'll be a wall  
As long as the dreamer remains  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning

On days when she says she can't think straight  
Or she feels like she's getting the jumps  
She'll go shoot off her. 38  
At cans on a Donkey Town dump  
  
It was Friday late and she crossed those legs  
She told me flat out she would. Yeah

My..(baby..baby)  
I was up in the club putting my hood high  
When I saw you, and I stood by  
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie  
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet  
But only one thing could keep me off the street

I can be why you always be fly  
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-B does

Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama  
First I'ma put you on your back  
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track  
  
Then I'ma lay you on your side  
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside  
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side  
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride  
And my baby know how to start me up  
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up  
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills  
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real  
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple  
And won't we make a good...(baby)?

But you're so amazing

Say you'll be my baby

My baby's the only one I bring to the villa  
That can get the bling and the scrilla  
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla  
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller

I'm a motherfuckin' ghetto superstar nigga  
Got my nigga Paul Cain with me  
Street dreams  
I'm what street dreams are made of nigga  
Hate me now  
Do it now nigga  
I'm burnin' like them blue flames nigga  
They call me G-H-E-T-T-O-  
Ghetto  
Lets do this right nigga  
What the fuck is up nigga?  
These niggas can't even breathe now Cain  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
It won't stop 'till my account is in the billions  
And I buy a home on the coast of Miami and the ammounts are in the millions  
Fish tanks and flat screens mounted in the ceilings  
Sippin' champagne I have trouble pronouncing while I'm chillin'  
Felt that you was squealin'  
You 'gon die even if Witness Protection put you in the mountains of New
Zealand  
Cause I hire bountys that be killin'  
That play Hide-And-Go Seek and find you after countin' to a million  
But a million records later  
Theres still some speculators  
Man these labels are giving the kid meals and checks like waiters  
When I come through you never see my heels be decked in gators  
And see Jordans that dropped when you was still a second grader  
Spill the Tec on haters  
I got a quick jab  
But when I squeeze these slugs'll hit you a milla second later  
I chill and check the waiter  
Dudes play gangsta for a minute but run to the cops squealing seconds later  
You still a Lexus trader  
My credit so good I drive off in the sc and tell the dealer ""Catch ya later""  
All I need is one night I don't deal with second daters  
Cause the white and gold stones on the grill and neck persuade her nigga  
  
[Paul Cain:]  
Yeah  
Yo Fab  
We done pulled the Range out  
The Benz out  
The Caddy truck out  
They ain't even see the 12-8 yet  
These niggas still hatin'  
  
[Verse 2: Paul Cain]  
Ever since I got signed it seems like ya'll been hatin' on the god  
We never held a conversation but you claimin' I'm a fraud  
Started bringin' weight up while I starve  
Gained some cash and the ego now ya perpetrating like ya hard  
If you thinkin' you Pac I'm a wait in front of Quad  
Have my Kingston bullets through ya face like I'm Bernard  
Ya like beef but hate when I'm involved  
Cause I don't give ya a chance ta dodge bullets from the 8 when it revolve  
Niggas love when you broke but they hate when you get large  
Wait for you to slip and try to find a way to get you robbed  
Run in ya crib and duck tape you and ya broad  
And don't leave prints so jakes never get the case resolved  
So I play against the odds  
When its all set two niggas with two 40s a peice retaliatin' on ya squad  
If you get locked my Haitian'll leave you scarred  
Rape you in the yard  
With Gem Star blades cut ya face like a collage  
While I sip champagne in the Vegas lamatage'  
In the suite with two freaks videotapin' a manage'  
Ice in the chain a face in the shepard'  
Million dollar crib with a cranberry quarter and a 8 in the garage nigga  
  
[Paul Cain:]  
Ya'll niggas  
Ya'll niggas only seen half  
This is just the begining man  
See ya'll niggas was hatin' now man  
Ya'll niggas gonna be sick to your stomach bending over throwin' up  
When ya'll see the shit we got comin'  
My album ain't even drop yet man  
And ya'll niggas talkin' crazy  
Man Paul Cain nigga  
The album comin' fourth quarter  
Ya'll motherfuckers is under pressure nigga  
Desert Storm, slk we killin' everything movin' nigga  
Yeah

You magnify the way I think about myself  
Before you came I rarely thought about myself  
  
Behind your veil I found a body underneath  
Inside your head were things I never thought about  
You know that I would love to see you next year

(Herman Hupfield)  
  
This day and age we're living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like third dimension  
  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, ""I love you""  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
  
(Queen Latifah) Times don't change, right?  
(Rod Stewart) Sing it to me, Latifah  
  
Oh, I'm singing it to you right now  
Cause we're talking about  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
As time goes by

The part of me that no one understands.

One 'til the end of time.  
I'll be someone standing by your side,

You just talking, and I'm the big shit  
Without mentioning my hit list, for instance  
Color dunk show, got 'em all yo  
Got a different car, under each garage do'  
From the Rolls Royce, that rides like hydro  
That white 550, nigga, kicking like Tae Bo

Fam' I did things, my major means  
At a pretty young age, I did major things  
I made major cream, I eat major greens  
First the yellow diamonds nigga, made ya bling  
Had the baddest bitches, on the major scene  
Fuck what ya heard and what you think you seen  
I fuck that bitch who come from Cover Girl, to Maybelline  
Quater million jewelry from, Las Van Dome  
Diamonds and plat', like glass and chrome

White girl in Africa, Black in Rome  
Philipina girl, just packing at home  
All the girls I get, I hack and moan  
Man I give 'em the dick, you know them bitches just gone  
Nigga raise ya funds, been crazier son  
But nigga ignorant, and Star Trak, take his fun  
I'm the keyboard killer, with the raz-or toungue  
Don't come back tellin me, what play-ers done  
I did it big, and I made it fun  
I made a ton, oh yeah the Rolls Royce got sacadelic flowers  
Painted on it, and I'm leaning on a nigga wit a lazor gun  
The house in Virginia, that's what I'm living in  
Building in Carribean, fillin 'em and buildin' 'em

But I'm getting by  
Yeah I know what you've always told me  
Cow girls don't cry

But does the wind still blow in oklahoma  
Out here the hollywood stars sure shine bright  
It's such a long way from home here in California  
Missin you and that blue wide open sky

Out here it's all freeway fast cars  
Cold concrete  
You won't believe all the crazy people  
Bally girls sun sets free  
I met a girl you're gonna like her mama  
She has your hair  
Red as the telecross sunset  
Seems like an angel I swear  
I can't say I don't get lonsome  
But I'm alright  
Cow boys kinda go with homesick  
Like blue moons and whipperwill nights

Do you know what I know

If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position.  
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference,  
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen.  
I go from records with Dwele and LB and eLZhi,  
The meetings where they tell me to  
Start making records and t hey'll buy,  
Now I'm at in A-Town,  
A tellin' me trey sounds,  
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' a-round.  
But the allure of this year's scream tour  
Has been cuttin' all them jawns that be hurtin' the game.  
I be dreamin' bout hoes and doin' them loud shows,  
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train.  
Dog, personally maine,  
I'm a person that came to bring purpose  
To a seem unless they purpose is game.  
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame,  
Now my thoughts getting' deeper and I'm searchin' the game,  
I keep on, on, on, on, on

Who grows fasta.  
The young and incredible while lightin' yo ass up,  
You look a lil red, we getting that cash up.  
See where we from,  
The 50s are bloody and the 100-dollar bill  
Is dirty brown they love me.  
I mess up my livin' room, the studio with my money,  
A g-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of,  
My lapel, is custom-made,  
You off the rack shit,  
I'm off the chain, come on.  
The dogs are loose,  
And yeah we get at themon like san frisco bay,  
With 40 and mac dre.  
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to  
Me or one of my folk,  
Drake'll give you the deal.  
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills,  
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill.  
Keep on, keep on (uh), keep on (uh), keep on (uh)

Ol' time killin'.  
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin',  
And now the girls like,  
It's only drake got chased and so the artists  
I respected try and take my place,  
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin',  
They one in the same when you need it to happen.  
My city full of players they just needed a captain,  
In-need of him right now and needed him him back then.  
But back then I was act-in',  
Now-a-days I serve back-hands with back-spin.  
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men,  
Whoever chose to back out is back in,  
They say there's two sides to every story  
And three when the truth get told,  
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold.  
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old.  
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold.  
And keep on, on, on, on, on

Get in the car and get behind me,  
And when we're finished baby please don't try to find me,  
Quit playin games we can play this thang the same,  
There's a couple things I wanna do to you before I become a stranger,  
(Don't wanna know you)

I'm an American, boys, and I've come a long way,  
Born and bred in the USA  
So listen up close, I've got something to say  
Boys, I'm buying this round  
Well it took a little while, but we're in this fight  
And we ain't going home 'til we've done what's right  
We're gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight,  
If I have to spend my last pound  
  
When I first got to London it was pourin' down rain  
Met a little girl in the field canteen  
Painted her name on the nose of my plane  
Six more missions, I'm gone  
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might  
Then the warden came around yelling ""Turn out the lights""  
Death rainin' out of the London night  
We made love 'til dawn  
  
[Chorus:]  
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home  
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan  
They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone  
When Johnny comes marching home  
  
My P-47 is a pretty good ship  
And she took a round comin' cross the channel last trip  
I was thinkin' 'bout my baby and letting her rip  
Always got me through so far  
Well they can ship me all over this great big world  
But I'll never find nothing like my North End girl  
I'm taking her home with me one day, sir  
Soon as we win this war  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now my grandaddy sang this song  
Told me about London when the Blitz was on  
How he married grandma and brought her back home  
A hero thoughout his land  
Now I'm standing on a runway in San Diego  
A couple Purple Hearts and I move a little slow  
There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows  
About a place called Vietnam

I live a life I never chose,  
But these thoughts in my mind,  
Are my own, my own  
  
I'm face to face with the unknown,  
My scary movie will be shown,  
I've got one evil mind,  
My own, my own

We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
Little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry, I understand  
So...  
  
I'm a target although smart,  
They got amunition I got heart,  
I'm analyized and tagged,  
Before I start  
  
So tell me who can I respect,  
I feel the leash around my neck,  
As I find out the shame,  
In the game (in the game)  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
  
And I feel like I've crawled outside the box  
And I feel like I'm sleeping when I'm not  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
Little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry, I understand  
You little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)

1970 Somethin' nigga i don't sweat the date my moms was late,  
So i had to plan my escape, out the skins,  
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,  
Untill i call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck,  
I wish moms would hurry up, so i can get buck wild,  
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,  
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2:19 was when my moma water burst,  
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,  
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,  
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck,  
Im seein' my death, and i ain't even took my first step,  
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,  
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY!  
  
[Faith Evans]  
  
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars
and nines, i knew that i was  
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before i even got the rhyme,
before i had nickels and  
Dimes, i knew that i was goin' somewhere,

Would pac be alive, if u let pac drive,  
Swear to god to reverse it i give my left eye,  
With the right i visualized, the king of bed-stuy,  
Checkin his daughter tianna into junior high,  
If i was in brooklyn, and B.I. was still alive,in 2006 it might sound like
this,  
N.Y. 718 212, with sues rendevouz,  
Its like moulin rouge,  
High fashion, up town air force ones,  
And vasquez, puerto ricans with fat asses  
Lace dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S classes,  
For you bastards, catch a cab to manhattan,  
With that broadway actin', u hype that belly shit,  
Would u get u capped, and wrapped in plastic,  
Tell the captain, S Roge was happennin',  
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the magnum

Now i'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green,  
On the drug scene, fuck the football team,  
Risk it, rupt ur spleens, by the age of 16,  
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,  
I mean, i wanna blow up, stack my doe up,  
So school i didn't show up, and fucked my flow up,  
Mom said that i should grow up, and check myself,  
Before i wreck myself, disrespect myself,  
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! i couldn't see it,  
Scarface king of New York, i wanna be it,  
Rap was secondary, money was neccessary,  
Untill i got encarcerated, kinda scary,  
See 74' march 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,  
Time to contemplate, damn were did i fail,  
All the money i stacked, was all the money for bail,

'Cause I do things from the M-town  
To the uk  
From Spain back out to Texas

But yo this hook is for my exes

This one is for you girl  
You know who you are girl  
You only show you're face  
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl  
What you trying to to make it  
Don't ever mistake it  
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you  
You had a chance now It's gone  
Oooooh  
You had a man now you don't  
Back to the basics  
I think I made it  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl  
  
[Verse 2-Trey Songz]  
Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly  
Lookin for someone your type  
I done left behind the love of my life  
Tryin to find another one tonight  
And if it's you baby  
Let yourself be seen  
Don matter skirts  
Dresses or jeans

And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean

[Verse 3-Drake]  
Check this out  
From the that she get picked for some take out  
Until they slip up and break out  
But it's another story over here at Drake's house  
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out  
And I'm lean back  
Scoping  
Looking for a woman that I should wife  
Who got just the right amount of loyalty  
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life  
We go la, va  
Ny, to  
Sunshine in that heat stroke  
And them fur hoods in that deep snow  
We have breakfast in the bedroom  
Break bread downstairs in the basement  
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more  
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement

Happy holidays y'all, give me a gift  
Let me sing a little jingle while you drink that fifth (Jingle Bells)  
Tell Santa that he better stop frontin'  
That cookie eatin' mother fucker never leavin' nothin'  
But this year I swear I won't let it happen  
Sleighs, gifts and reindeer we Christmas jackin' (gimme that)  
Surround sound, hot chocolate for days  
Bumpin' through the neighborhood, actin' like we paid (look what we got)  
We had to get him, it was just that time  
J and I was fed up, and we wanted to shine (wanted to shine)  
But now we got anything you ever wanted  
Yeah, he was old but he had a fat wallet (cha-ching)  
Only workin' one day a year  
With a plush-red suit and a iced-out beard  
Slingin' snow in the north pole to a bunch of fiends  
Little guys with big ears that make toys for free  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)  
(Violent J)  
Uh, it was cold out, I seen a fat man comin'  
I hid behind a chimney  
And bust him in the skull with a bottle of Jim Beam  
I rolled him off the roof and onto the driveway  
And jumped in his sleigh ride and tried to fly away  
Rudolph bossed off on me, he wouldn't move  
I had to kick him in his ass, outta put him in groove  
Take me to the hood, to all the poor little kids  
This year, everybody about to get some good shit  
We landed on a house, I went for the chimney  
But the roof was feeble, I crashed through and smashed through the kitchen
table  
Daddy came bustin' out the bedroom strapped  
Third shot blew off my Santa hat, fuck that  
I ran out the back door and I hopped a wall  
Steady whistlin' for the reindeer, but they're like fuck off, then took off  
I almost caught a slug in the ass, and became a ghost of Christmas past over
that shit (over that bullshit)  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)

Dashing through the snow, smokin' lots of dro  
Pullin' chicks with expensive gifts  
Just to get that ho ho ho, you know what I mean  
Don't get us wrong, we're gonna give to the kids  
Super Santa's hookin' up all the little shits (here ya go)  
And for the grown-up's, we gettin' to' up  
A case of malt liquor, and a sack that makes ya throw up  
(Violent J)  
Santy Claus wears panty drawers  
He never decked my halls, he can lick my balls  
I got no chimney, but I left the door unlocked  
Nothin' but pine needles and an empty sock  
Thanks a lot and fuck off fatass  
Why we need coats for kids if you so badass  
Only rich boys get big toys from Santa  
I waited all night in my pajamas mother fucker

Take your ass to bed. Fuck Santa Claus

Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom  
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on go on

Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts  
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts  
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts  
There's something I might say, There's something I might play  
A beat I might make might make they life change  
And save their whole deal, Their wrist is on chill  
They house is on hill, You could be Lauren Hill  
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on

You was a vic in high school now you a thug  
Better step in the name of love  
Before you giving pain a hug  
Needing dope is like pain to drugs  
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged  
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords  
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it  
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice  
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night  
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice  
I'm on point like I speak to dice  
Took the underground at a steeper heights

If there is something  
That I might find  
Look around corners  
Try to find peace of mind,  
I say  
""Where would you go  
If you were me?  
Trying to keep a straight course  
Is not easy""  
  
Somebody special  
Looking at me  
Same kind of reaction  
Wanted to cry with me  
If there are many  
Too easy to say  
When it's love  
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame  
  
I would do anything for you  
I would come all day  
I would swim all the oceans blue  
I would walk a thousand miles  
Reveal my secrets  
More than enough for me to share  
I will put roses around your door  
Sit in the garden  
Growing potatoes by the score  
  
Shake your head girl,  
With your ponytail  
Takes me right back  
[when you were young]  
Throw your precious gifts into the air  
Watch them fall down  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
It used to fall apart  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The hills were higher  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The trees were taller then  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The grass was greener

Hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors  
A typewriter cackles out a stream of memories  
  
Drying out a conscience, evicting a nightmare  
Opening the doors for the dreams to come home  
  
We live out lives in private shells  
Ignore our senses and fool ourselves  
To thinking that out there there's someone else cares  
Someone to answer all our prayers, all our prayers...  
  
Are we too far gone, are we so irresponsible  
Have we lost our balls, or do we just not care  
We're terminal cases that keep talking medicine  
Pretending the end isn't quite that near  
We make futile gestures, act to the cameras  
With our made up faces and pr smiles  
And when the angel comes down, down to deliver us  
We'll find out that after all, we're only men of straw  
  
But everything is still the same  
Passing the time passing the blame  
We carry on in the same old way  
We'll find out we left it too late one day to say what we meant to say  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water  
Those problems seem to arise the ones you never really thought of  
The feeling you get is similar to something like drowning  
Out of your mind, you're out of your depth, you should have taken soundings  
Clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws  
  
And if you ever come across us don't give us your sympathy  
You can buy us a drink and just shake our hands  
And you'll recognise by the reflection in our eyes that deep down inside we're
all one and the same  
  
We're clutching at straws  
We're still drowning  
Clutching at straws  
We're still drowning, yeah clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning  
We're clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning

You need a holiday, somewhere in the sun

Hurry up and wait  
So close, but so far away  
Everything that you've always dreamed of  
Close enough for you to taste  
But you just can't touch  
  
[Bridge]  
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet  
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it  
You know you can if you get the chance  
In your face and the door keeps slamming  
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated  
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting  
We live and we learn to take

Or falling in love

Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time

You believe and you doubt  
You're confused, you got it all figured out  
Everything that you always wished for  
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours  
If they only knew

When you can't wait any longer  
But there's no end in sight  
When you need to find the strength  
It's the faith that makes you stronger  
The only way we get there  
Is one step at a time

Nang basahin ko humihingi siya ng tulong

Siya'y amoy-alak, mata'y namumula  
Kaya daw naglasing, dahil sa problema

Sa awa ko, dinukot ko ang piso sa bulsa  
Ang sabi niya, ay mama kulang dagdagan pa  
Kaya ako dumukot ng sampo dinagdagan

Siya'y sinundan ko, di n'ya nalalaman  
At siya'y nakita kong pumasok sa ihaw-ihaw.

Ako'y lumapit sa kanya

Hank Williams,THE GREAT JUDGEMENT MORNING Writer ?,/h/hank+williams/the+great+judgement+morning+writer+_20064187.html,"(G) I dreamed that the great judgement (C) morning,  
Had (G) dawned, and the trumpet had (D7) blown,  
I (G) dreamed that all nations had (C) gathered,  
To (G) judgement be- (D7) fore the white (G) throne.  
From the throne came A bright shining (C) angel,  
And he (G) stood on the land and the (D7) sea,  
And (G) swore with his hand raised to (C) heaven,  
That (G) time was no (D7) longer to (G) be.  
Chorus  
And oh what weeping and (C) wailing,  
As the (G) lost were told of their (D7) fate,  
They (G) cried for the rocks and the (C) mountains,  
They (G) prayed, but their (D7) prayers were too (G) late.  
The rich man was there but his money,  
Had melted and vanished away,  
A pauper stood there in the judgement,  
His debts were too many to pay.  
The great man was there, but his greatness,  
When death came, was left far behind,  
The angel that opened the records,  
No trace of his greatness could find.  
Repeat chorus  
The widow was there and the orphan,  
God heard and remembered their cries,  
No sorrow in heaven forever,  
God wiped all the tears from their eyes.  
The gambler was there and the drunkard,  
And they who had sold them the drink,  
With people who gave them the license,  
Together in hell they did sink.  
Repeat chorus  
The moral man to the judgement,  
But self rightousness would not do,  
For the men who had crucified jesus,  
Had passed off as moral men too.  
And the souls that had put off salvation,  
Not tonight I'll get saved by and by,  
No time now to think of salvation,  
At last they had found time to die.

Nothing to believe in  
And you can't find a way back home

There's a visionary sister  
Who knows what's right or wrong?

I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle

And you lose your resistance  
Slipping down on the darkest side  
You can push too hard  
You can run too fast  
Don't get lost in the looking glass  
Little by little the wheel turns around  
And one day I'll be satisfied  
Like the hand that rocks the cradle  
I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle

Album: Wildest Dreams (96)  
  
When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it  
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart  
  
Something's gone, I can't explain  
The heat is missing from the plain  
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain  
There's something wrong with you and me  
When more than one adds up to three  
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say  
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
when you do what you do without love, without love

The only colour I need is blue  
You're out of love, baby you know it's true  
Tell me why and I'll try to understand  
  
Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
When you do what you do without love  
  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say  
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
Then you know it's a crime that you kill me up  
When you do what you do without love, without love  
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing without love

Producers: Brian Rawlings and Mark Taylor  
Album: Twenty Four Seven (99)  
  
Once in a lifetime you find  
Someone to show you the way  
Someone to make your decisions  
But I let you lead me astray  
Who did you think you were fooling  
Said you were missing me blind  
But the truth is I knew you were lying  
You were using me time after time  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
Time to move on with my life now  
Leaving the past all behind  
I can make my own decisions  
It was only a matter of time  
Sometimes I look back in anger  
Thinking about all the pain  
But I know that I'm stronger without you  
And that I'll never need you again  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Yeah I can live without you  
Live without you

It's a disease and they're all green  
It emanates from their being  
A satiation with occupation  
And like weeds with big leaves  
Stealing light from what's beneath  
Where they have more  
Still they take more  
I know, then I don't  
There's a stow-away with my throat  
It's deceiving, I don't believe him  
We can scream out our doors  
Behind the wall, a fat man snores  
In his dreams, he's choking ti leaves  
Well I guess there's nothing wrong with what you say  
But don't sell me, ""there can't be better ways""  
Tell the captain, ""the boat's not safe, and we're drowning""  
Turns out he's the one making waves, waves, waves...  
I said there's nothing wrong with what you say  
Believe me, I'm just asking you to sway  
No white or black, just grey  
Can you feel this world with your heart and not your brain?  
Brain...

Had too many bills to pay, seven mouths to feed  
Movin' to the city was all that I could do

Santa works all day in his workshop  
Making lots of games and toys  
Then one day, he hops in his sleigh  
To bring them to the girls and boys  
Santa's just as nice as he can be  
There's just one little thing that worries me  
  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh  
In case of rain, will there be a train  
That'll speed him on his way  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope it's not in vain  
I'd really feel much better  
If I knew he could fly a plane

For the sleigh he's driving here  
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
And where have you been, my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,  
Its a hard, and its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin,  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin,  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,  
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin,  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,  
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin,  
Heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin,  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin,  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,  
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony,  
I met a white man who walked a black dog,  
I met a young woman whose body was burning,  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,  
I met one man who was wounded in love,  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,  
Its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, whatll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And whatll you do now, my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin back out fore the rain starts a-fallin,  
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest,  
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,  
The executioners face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,  
Where black is the color and none is the number,  
And Ill tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,  
Reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,  
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinkin,  
But Ill know my song well before I start singin,  
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Its a hard rains a gonna fall  
Its a hard rains a gonna fall

Hey Slim how long's it been  
Five minutes maybe 10  
Can't wait to see you again and again  
First taste of this romance  
Hell baby I almost danced  
Caught myself close to believing  
But every time is a brand new feeling  
Lay me down in cool clear water  
For a moment I've forgot her  
Still I know where this is leading  
  
Win, lose, which we choose  
Won once and once refused  
Already burning down the fuse  
Don't wanna be building walls  
Cause everything rising falls  
It's darkness here the light's concealing  
Love it seems is too revealing  
Hidden in some secret place  
Etched in lines around my face  
The ghosts in here are all competing  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm  
  
Down, down we all fall down  
Down, down we all fall down  
We all fall down, yeah we all fall down  
Let's toast to new love blooming  
It's all around and all consuming  
It's a dream you're bound to follow  
Til you find it's only hollow  
I can hear the angels grieving  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm

It took a long time  
But now I'm gonna be laughing  
A very long time  
When all I could feel was sad  
A very long time  
But now it's gonna be worth it  
Cause I just found a friend to make me glad  
I'm feeling food, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
I'm gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good, feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm blowing my own trumpet  
Cause all I wanna do is join up with the band  
When you feel good  
You gotta come right out and say it  
I've been so long at sea and I've just seen land  
I'm feeling food, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
I'm gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good, feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good, feeling better  
I'm feeling best

Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn

I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain  
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame  
Pockets that stay empty dreams that go astray  
God has my fortune laid away

Some people live in riches while some live just like me  
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay

From the flip-side of the empire  
Hand on my heart  
Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radio-beacon  
That's sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards  
Hey, tell me it's true  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face,  
Do I still walk on the same structure?  
Hey, what do we know  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru' a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Can't understand what you say  
But I think that you're calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In real-time-precision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey, tell me it's true,  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure?  
Hey, what do we know,  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real

Melting gently in the cold structure

Everybody hopes to get off the trap  
All we really like is to groove with emotion  
Waiting for the airline to lift us up...

Winding down the window clever again  
You know manual is far too old  
To keep pace then he left us cold  
  
It's automatic, it's automatic  
It's automatic, it goes by itself  
  
  
Quick thinking and a mutual aim  
So on finding out the name of the game

The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find

It is the roar of the wind,  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see

Our love, has brought us both together  
And it's our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before it's time

It is the trees in the earth,  
It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,  
You'll remember it all

Of pleasure and pain  
Life carries on  
A cloak of deceit  
Brings honour to shame  
But the voice I used to know  
(Where are you now?)  
Is the one I can't let go  
Chorus:  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A Distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
You are the first, You are the last  
I'help you to see  
The light in the dark  
The sun through the rain  
Until you are free  
And facing the truth  
That words can't explain  
But the truth I think you know(Tell me)  
I could never let you go  
Chorus  
you are the future from the past  
You are the spell that has been cast  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
Chorus  
You are the first  
You are the last to me  
Oom hm.....You are to me...You are

Do you know you take my heart through the door  
Are there words to tell you what I live for

I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
  
Let me dry your eyes  
Is this the last time I can hold you?  
There's hope in this soul  
And words that will tread where you go to  
  
Is it true, you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you, will always be with me

To lose and gain  
But when the sun was taken  
You never shone so bright

The blind were given sight

Far away

I can see how much I was taking it all  
For granted  
Among the silent victims  
Only the wind would moan  
And for a time I felt us touch  
The great unknown  
For that eternal moment  
Oh what a price to pay  
With nothing left but all we have  
We slowly walked away

Silver framed and velvet backed  
Well, she took it quite a while ago  
Funny that she never let me know

Just a little history

Gilded hair to pay the dues

This time, you won't end in tears  
I find myself, with a new daddy  
My mama needs love you see  
Guess she don't wanna be lonely  
  
And nobody's keeping score  
I don't say hi to those guys no more  
Said mama can't you feel me  
Holding my breath as they knock, knock, knock on our door

Taking the pill that you know will kill you

He gets laid, every day  
Johnny please please, stop pretending

Take care of yourself  
Because you won't find 'daddy'  
When you're popping those pills  
Oh Johnny, is the danger just part of the thrill?  
  
And nobody's keeping score

I said ""Johnny can't you hear them  
Saying mama knows best as they knock, knock,  
Knock on your door""

The same, the same, the same  
  
Pretty girl, little girl, what were you thinking  
Just 18 at the time  
You were a mother and child, at the same time  
You were a mother and child  
So young and fucked up baby  
Always higher than a child should see  
Forgive me  
  
To the top of that building  
Under cars and trains  
Taking the pill that you know will kill you  
Under the wheels, wheels, wheels  
  
Mama don't you let him stay  
  
From bastard to loser, hurt you, used you in every way,  
Mama, don't let him stay, please  
Don't let him stay  
  
I said Jesus, Mary, and the Saints above,  
Won't you show him love?

We filled the church and hired a preacher  
I raised her veil to reach her  
Lives on the promise of her youth  
But forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Eternity can not be messed with  
The law says you might confess to  
Enough coals, hotter hell you fool  
Then you swear an oath and then take it back, anytime you choose  
That forever don't last the way it used too

I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)  
  
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine  
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine  
I'm finna take yall back to them better times  
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind  
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi  
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold  
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul  
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?  
You work late nights just to keep on the lights  
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike  
And you would give anything in this world  
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl  
And you never put no man over me  
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?  
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes  
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry  
As we knelt on the kitchen floor  
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more  
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more  
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford  
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable  
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot  
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do  
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates  
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate  
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with  
But still supported me when I did the opposite  
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get  
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you  
You was getting through, can the choir please  
Give me a verse of ""You, Are So Beautiful To Me""  
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry  
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy  
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet  
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

Second they get up you gon get that Benzo  
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)  
  
Tell your job you gotta fake em out  
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out  
To a restaurant, upper echelon  
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want  
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?  
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right  
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday  
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)

That's why she's making six figures working three days a week  
Ya she'd even break a promise in the promised land  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
  
(Hey, hey) I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book  
City Hall would probably fall if anyone got a look  
Every A list player is a favorite friend  
Says they all taste the same in the back of the Benz  
Her congressman will call her every once in a while  
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile  
She's done everyone once, and everyone knows  
You got to get a little dirty when you're digging for gold  
  
(Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed  
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press  
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best  
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest  
Ya he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands.

and then to have a hammer in the Carolina  
when you hear the whistle blowing into the bar  
then you now the Tennessee is not very far

I let the genie out of the box  
I'm scared of everything I am  
I let the genie out of the box  
I'm scared of opening the can  
I let the genie out of the box  
I had this recurring dream  
I was living another life  
In another country  
In another time  
As I got older the dream began to fade away  
Until one day  
There she was.. tapping me on my shoulder  
She says she's got so much to say  
But she's not telling it today  
She said ""Come back when you're alone""  
But I'm not sure I want to know  
Cause maybe her road  
Is a one-way street  
Maybe her road..  
I'm scared of everything I am  
I'm scared of opening the can  
I'm scared of losing who I am  
Think I might've taken all I can  
I let the genie out of the box  
She said there's a house in your mind  
An attic of treasure, a forgotten pleasure park  
Waiting inside you in the dark  
Don't leave it behind  
Don't leave it behind  
I'm scared of everything I am  
I'm scared of opening the can  
I'm scared of losin' who I am

Out of the box

Absence makes the heart go mad  
All the solid things become mirages  
The certain things  
Sand running in the hour glass  
Running away  
I scream along the ledge  
As the windows back and close  
I run around try to prove the sunrise  
I believe in belief  
But it's proof I need  
Can you show me it's me  
Can you show me it's me  
Travelling makes the mind go vague  
All the special faces fade away  
Spinning like a heat haze  
Shimmering  
Please send Polaroids  
Or an ear in the post  
A map to the treasure  
A key to the closed  
I need you like hell  
Can you help me again  
Can you show me it's me  
Can you show me it's me  
I run dry  
I run out  
I run cold  
I need help  
Trying to prove the sunrise  
Trying to prove the tides  
Trying to prove the blue moon sky  
And is it you?  
Is it you?

(Wait a minute)  
(Come on! whew)  
Just let me catch my breath  
I've heard the promises  
I've seen the mistakes  
I've had my fair share of tough breaks  
I need a new voice, a new law, a new way  
Take the time, reevaluate  
It's time to pick up the pieces  
Go back to square one  
I think it's time for a change  
  
There is something that I feel  
To be something that is real  
I feel the heat within my mind  
And craft new changes with my eyes  
Giving freely wandering promises  
A place with decisions I'll fashion  
I won't waste another breath  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
(It's time to take the time)  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
The unbroken spirit obscured and disquiet  
Finds clearness this trial demands  
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief  
For the fortune lies still in his hands  
If there's a pensive fear, a wasted year  
A man must learn to cope  
If his obsession's real  
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope  
  
Life is no more assuring than love  
(It's time to take the time)  
There are no answers from voices above  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
And no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
I close my eyes  
And feel the water rise around me  
Drown the beat of time  
Let my senses fall away  
I can see much clearer now I'm blind  
  
(Ora che ho perso la vista)  
(Ci vedo di piu)  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
(It's time to take the time)  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
Find all you need in your mind  
If you take the time

Sayin' we all look the same, huh  
God bless America, home of the brave  
I'd rather dress to make a woman stare  
I'm puttin' on somethin' that another won't dare  
It's a freezer burn compared to cool  
And if you still got loot, then who's the fool?  
Everybody want to take the stand

In the aftermath of the jihad  
We were looking for lowlife scum  
There were bombs and guns  
In caves and things  
But Osama must have sprouted some wings  
  
The next thing we saw was a videotape  
And the proof  
It left no doubt  
The heat was hot  
But the trails been cold  
And Bin-Laden has not been fun  
  
He could be ridin' through the desert  
On a horse with Hussein  
It felt good to get out of the caves  
In the desert you can make up a fake name  
And there ain't no bombs  
For to give you no pain  
  
With his beard shaved  
In the desert sun  
Osama begins to turn to red  
In the sun's rays  
You know It ain't no fun  
He's gonna need a another towel for his head  
Some Groucho Marx glasses  
And a nose that sticks out  
Is the perfect disguise  
It's been said  
Avoid the city life  
And don't make a sound  
Or the Marines will fill you with lead  
  
He could be ridin' through the desert  
On a horse with Hussein  
It felt good to get out of the caves  
In the desert you can make up a fake name  
And there ain't no bombs

He seemed so happy holdin' you again how many times will he kiss you tonight

And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi  
  
Meccha leccha hi, meccha hiney hiney ho  
  
Our temple's had a fair share of rabbis in the past  
But most of'em were nudniks and none of'em would last  
But our new guy's real kosher, I think he'll do the trick  
I tell ya, he's to die for - he really knows his shtick  
  
So how's by you? Have you seen this Jew?  
Reads the Torah, does his own accounting too  
Working' like a dog at the synagogue  
He's there all day, he's there all day  
  
Just say ""Vay is mir!"" and he'll kick into gear  
He'll bring you lots of cheer and maybe bagels with some shmeer  
Just grab your yarmulka and  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly (for a rabbi)  
  
He shops at discount stores, not just any will suffice  
He has to find a bargain 'cause he won't pay retail price  
He never acts meshugga and he's hardly a schlemiel  
But if you want to haggle, oy, he'll make you such a deal!  
  
People used to scoff, now they say ""Mazel tov!""  
He's such a macher 'cause he works his tuchis off  
Yeah, he keeps his cool and teaches shul  
What's not to like? What's not to like?  
  
Oh high holy days, you know he prays and prays  
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise  
Put on your yarmulka and  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!  
  
When he's doing a Bar Mitzvah, now that you shouldn't miss  
He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss  
They say he's got a lot of chutzpah, he's really quite hhhhhip  
The parents pay the moyl and he gets to keep the tip!  
  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!

The yentas love him, even shicksas think he's swell  
Show up at his home, he says, ""Shalom!""  
And ""Have some cake-You want some cake?""  
  
Yeah he calls the shots, we really love him lots  
Oy gevalt, I'm so ferklempt that I could plotz!

But one more time, I don't want the family business  
Don't want to inherit it upon the day that you die

You know elisabeth, you know elisabeth  
She has a better head for those things than I  
She lives practically around the corner  
That's really the kind of child you could be proud of  
But papa, I know that this visit's a mistake  
There's nothing here we have in common, except our name  
And families that live out in the suburbs  
Often make each other cry  
And I don't think that I'll come home much anymore

All breathe a sigh together

and I will always care. Through weakness and strength, happiness and  
sorrow, for better or worse, I will love you with every beat of my  
heart.)  
  
From this moment life has begun  
From this moment you are the one  
Right beside you  
is where I belong  
From this moment on  
  
From this moment I have been blessed  
I live only for your happiness  
And for your love I'd give my last breath  
From this moment on  
  
I give my hand to you with all my heart  
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start  
You and I will never be apart  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
From this moment as long as I live  
I will love you, I promise you this  
There is nothing I wouldn't give  
From this moment on  
  
You're the reason I believe in love  
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above  
All we need is just the two of us  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
From this moment as long as I live  
I will love you, I promise you this  
There is nothing I wouldn't give  
From this moment  
I will love you  
I will love you as long as I live

unless I see it with you.)

Will be a lovely day,  
A bright new sun will suddenly break through,  
But I don't want to see tomorrow,  
Unless I see it with you.  
Tomorrow, so I hear  
The clouds will disappear,  
The door to happiness will open wide.  
But I don't want to see tomorrow,  
Unless you're there by my side.  
Don't want to walk alone,  
Don't want to dream alone,  
Just want you close to my heart.  
For if your love is gone,  
How can I face the dawn of  
Sunday, or Monday?  
I just can't face one day...  
Until you say you're mine,  
Oh, darling, please be mine  
And make each bright tomorrow young and new.  
But I don't want to face tomorrow  
Unless I see it with you.

But never so close  
So deep in my soul, so much I've been told

Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver  
Can't let go i got fans in Okinawa  
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors  
Norway no you didn't get my flowers  
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward  
Face just showers, the minute in a hour  
Heard about the news all day went sour  
Lil mama got me feeling like a Lemonhead  
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes  
Give em my regards or regardless i get arrested  
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless  
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace

And i put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix

'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket  
Clean next get a call just a lil' visit  
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid  
Reality see when your blessed just kill critics  
Buggatti never when im rich, just god fearing  
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring  
Gotta good feeling, plus the right caring, tell his Billie Jeans  
I'm on another planet  
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries  
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit  
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish  
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish  
No cheers i know you wouldn't panic

No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight  
No one to tell my troubles to  
I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me  
  
Tight  
No one to chear me when I'm blue  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
One prayer  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
  
Someone to whisper I love you  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
  
One prayer  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you

(My mother will start to worry) Beautiful watch you're wearing  
(My father will be pacing the floor) Listen to the fireplace roar  
(So really I'd better scurry) Beautiful please don't hurry  
(Well maybe just half a drink) Put some records on while I pour

Hank Snow,I See Jesus,/h/hank+snow/i+see+jesus_20797130.html,"(I see Jesus standing waiting for me)  
Once a man named Steven preached about the Lord  
Folks were saved then folks were healed as they heard his word  
Satan did not like it soon he had his crowd  
And as he was tried they heard Steven cried aloud  
I see Jesus standing at the father's right end I see Jesus over in the
Promised Land  
Work is over now I'm coming to be I see Jesus standing waiting for me  
  
As the stones fell on him beating out his life  
Steven knew he'd soon be through with all toil and strife  
So much like a Master with a heart so true  
He prayed Lord forgive them for they know not what they do  
  
Through the gates of glory down the streets of gold  
March the hero on the Lord into heaven's fold  
When he met the Saviour at the great white throne  
I believed he smiled and said Steven welcome home  
  
I see Jesus...

I went to see what I could find  
Like flowers in the dead of night  
Like shadows in the moonlight--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
A choir with a single voice--A picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
CHORUS  
It isn't true  
I am not the ghost  
Without a soul . . . Come  
Listen to my heart  
You feel the beat . . . Stop  
Listen to the sound  
Of moving feet . . . Walk  
Through the halls at night  
When I'm asleep  
I don't believe . . .I don't believe  
The shoe is on the other foot--The glove is on the fist  
The first is like a cannonball--But it feels like a kiss  
I got a bed that's real soft--In a room that's always sad  
I thought I heard a window sigh--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
CHORUS  
A choir with a single voice--a picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
I sip the running water--Like rivers from your eyes

I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--I thought I'd go and see  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be me

See you, soon now, the boat moves with the wind  
China, china, I can see the harbour lights  
Light your, fire, we'll be warm tonight  
  
China, china, the thoughts drift from the sea  
I'm dreaming, of you, wear your dress for me  
China, china, the oceans on the wheel(? )  
The seagulls flying lower now  
China I can feel you by my side  
Across the bay, across the tyne  
Can you hear me say  
  
China, china, wear your hair down low  
Lady, lady, you're frozen to the bone  
China, china, the catch was good today  
The oilskins clinging to my back  
And the lantern gently sways  
  
Oh don't you cry, the kids to bed  
Didn't mean the things I said  
  
China, china, the years go rolling by  
Laughter, sorrow, I will not make you cry  
China, china, think before you speak  
Always remember the ocean hauls as deep  
And if I'm tired of feeling low  
Don't let me sleep, you know

Drinking, smoking, talking quietly  
The water's calmer now

child""

And he's inside you - 'n I am too - so here we are - just the three of you""

again""  
  
""there's no religion - you did that - it helps to keep your little leaders fat

But when you talk of time and life - it makes me think of circles, heights  
Expansion is the clue - your dreams - are nearer than you've ever been""

And not this theatre of the absurd.

But an interesting thing occurred  
See nobody ever shared too much  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
And there I was back in london,  
Thought about history.  
It was just like being in school again  
But I felt something movin' in me.  
Hearin' just a bit of the future,  
Oh it's comin' and it's still blurred  
And that's the only thing worth living for  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
  
Come on,  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours.  
Oh play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower.  
  
(beautiful)  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
(john, come on)  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Oh, play me some, (come on, eric) play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Oh, play me some, play me some,

Way back in the 50's - you never said a wrong word  
People were clean - people were mean  
Children should be seen, but children should be not heard  
You learned to keep your mouth shut - you did what you were told  
But then one day the radio played the sound that we'd all been waiting for  
The whole of our lives 'n'  
  
I still love Rock 'n' Roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along, singin' the song  
It's the only way - I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up in the morning - put the kettle on the stove  
Tommy Steele croons a Guy Mitchell tune  
I never felt more like singin' the blues - but if I had to choose  
You know I still love rock 'n' roll  
I still love rock 'n' roll (let me hear ya)  
  
I never been to Lubbock, Texas or Memphis, Tennessee  
I never washed dishes in Macon, Georgia  
I wasn't half as good and I wasn't half as pretty as you  
But I still got the feelings - embedded in my soul  
A rebel armada - Kettering, Granada  
It ain't my fault that I never grew up - I got bitten by your bug  
And I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock  
  
I know what you're thinkin' - it's a little bit strange to you  
I know what you're thinkin' - cause I'm thinkin' the same way too  
But oh those two little four letter words - they're all you need to know  
Cause when it all comes down to it - I don't like the sound of it  
When you mess around with it - I'm still in it for the thrill of it  
I know you tried to kill it but  
  
I still love rock 'n' roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along - singin' the songs  
It's the only way I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up every morning - I put the coffee on the stove  
The computer's gone - the turntable's on  
I can't believe it's 2001 - God, I must be knockin' on  
But I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll,

We walked to the sea, just my father and me  
And the dogs played around on the sand.  
Winter cold cut the air, hanging still everywhere  
Dressed in gray did he say hold my hand?  
I said love's easier when it's far away  
We sat and watched the distant lights.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
And we smile when we say it's alright.  
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight  
Like those ships that pass in the night.  
  
There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky.  
There's another that rides far behind.  
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide  
Ways apart as we drift on through time.  
He said it's harder now you're far away  
We only read you when you write.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
We both smile when we say it's alright.  
We're still here, oh it's just that we're out of sight

Well the times gettin' hard for you little girl  
I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over god's world  
You don't remember when you got your last meal  
And you forgot just how a woman feels  
You didn't know what rock n' roll was  
Until you met a drummer on a greyhound bus  
I got there in the nick of time  
Before he got his hands across your state line  
  
Well in the middle of the night  
On the open road  
And the heater don't work and it's oh-so cold  
You're gettin' tired baby, you're lookin' kinda beat  
The music of the street, drive you off your feet  
You didn't know how rock n' roll looked  
Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group  
Half-way home in the parking lot  
By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep  
All the blood on my hand and my les paul heat  
I can't leave you home cos you're runnin' around  
My best friend told me you're the best trick in town  
  
You didn't know that rock n' roll burned  
So you bought a candle and you loved and you learned  
You got the rhythm, you got the speed  
Mamma's little baby likes it short and sweet  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
I didn't know ya got a rock n' roll record  
Until a saw your picture on another guy's jacket  
You told me I was the only one  
And look at you now, well it's dark as it's dumb  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe

That's it baby, take one last look  
We gotta go catch a plane  
Then you won't die, and I won't die  
But we won't ever be the same  
Oh I can feel a mood coming down on me  
Such a good thing disappears  
I can sense the loss creeping up on us  
And it's deeper than any tears I've known  
You stepped into my dreams  
You opened up the door  
You stepped into my dreams  
I want you back for more  
You stepped into my dreams tonight  
In the shadows of the night you're sorry  
In the morning we was gone  
Won't you blow a kiss to me baby  
We both gotta be moving on  
Sometimes you see a lover and she's made for love  
But you let that lover slip by  
You believe and yet she's so hard to get  
And you never know the reasons why  
She stepped into your dreams  
She opened up your door  
She stepped into your dreams  
You want her so much more  
She stepped into your dreams tonight yeah  
Oh when you're doing what you're doing  
What do you think of me babe  
There ain't much else to say  
In another time, in another place  
Things might have turned out okay  
I can feel a darkness I can never conceal  
Sometimes I get just a little insane  
I can feel emotions like the mighty oceans  
They're driving me again, and I know  
You stepped into my dreams  
You opened up the door  
You stepped into my dreams  
I want you back for more  
You stepped into my dreams  
And I don't know what to do  
I'm so scared of losing you.

Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down  
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out  
This bitch over them with them pointin the chief out  
They want beef out here, they gon' get it  
In the worst way, i'ma show em how black play  
Roll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes

How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll  
Used to call my crib to see seventy-four  
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac  
Babe bro told him, 'you wanna get money, see black  
When you get home', we never had chance to get up  
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up  
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey  
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money

Fuckin witchu, that small time crack dealin nigga

And get away scot free without some type of injury  
Nah kill it, i'ma flip the script on you  
Same thing you did to me, i'ma do it to you  
Who knew she was the female rambo  
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door  
Life is out, snuffed all they mans in  
In the end, she had to be the last bitch standin  
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong  
Just like that she was gone, now it's over  
Assumin I'll go back to my everyday life  
Of a rich millionaire just rockin the mic  
Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt  
And admire how the chick went out

Free from the seasons and this state I'm in  
And oh, I can't hold it all under one love  
It was so long ago when we danced in the streets  
Now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway  
And I'm waltzing my days away  
Searching for this woman I love  
  
(I'm here if you see me)  
She had a history, joy and pain, and she chose to leave  
She had a thousand and one photographs that you would not believe  
She'll come to you in disguise, she's there in you children's eyes  
Still our mother, she's still your wife  
So let her  
  
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again, oh yeah  
Free from the reasons and this state I'm in  
And oh,(trust me) I can't hold it all  
(she ain't going anywhere) under one love  
(trust me, she told me, when you're ready she'll be there)  
It was so long ago (no, don't let go of her)  
When we kissed in the streets  
Now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway  
Then I'm waltzing my days away  
Searching for this woman I love  
  
(and the moment you see me, I will live in your life)  
(we will walk through my garden, I will see through you eyes)  
Waltzing my days away (and the moment)  
I was in despair (you see me) till she found me there (I will live)  
Every grown man cries (in your life) with his mother's eyes  
(we will walk) when you're ready too (through my garden)  
She'll come back to you (I will see through your eyes)  
Waltzing my days away (and the moment) she's waiting  
(you see me, I will live in your life)  
Waltzing my days (we will walk) she's waiting  
(through my garden, I will) father (see through your eyes)  
She's waiting (and the moment you see me)

Where do you end and where do I begin  
Both brains become one mind sensually  
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity  
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve  
Longing for the love of all the other nevers  
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction  
In the burning chill of please we bathe  
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave  
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction  
But of creation, elation in the re-making  
No taking in the relation, no taking in the relation  
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love  
Till ain't nothing but stankonia

Dusty Springfield,My Lagan Love,/d/dusty+springfield/my+lagan+love_20043997.html,"(Irish folk song sang by Dusty on her TV show in 1967)  
  
Where Lagan stream sings lullaby  
There grows a young man fair  
The twilight gleam is in his eye  
The night is on his hair  
And like a lovesick lenan he  
He hath my heart in thrall  
No life I owe, no liberty  
His love is lord of all  
  
And often when the beetles' horn  
Hath lulled the eve to sleep  
I steal unto his shieling lorn  
And thro' the dooring peep  
There on the cricket's singing stone  
He spears the bird in fire  
And hums in sad, sweet undertone  
The song of his desire

Life in a city living in L. A.  
Is a long way from Huddersfield town  
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven  
But that's where he get's his pork pie  
Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy  
Rugby and cricket's unknown  
Baseball and football they're making him lazy  
Your fan club says ""Rodney come home""  
  
[Chorus:]  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
Look down on Hollywood Hills  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels  
  
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels  
The Nautilus rusts in the yard  
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning  
He'll always live in L. A.  
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket  
And never comes out to pay bills  
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker  
And he always cheats when he deals  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
(Rodney's rap)  
Hello, let me introduce meself!  
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong.  
When I were a lad, I could lift up five  
Navies on an end of a shovel.  
The reason I never took martial arts because  
I was immensely fearsome and  
I'd probably kill everybody  
I came into contact with it.  
I was phenomenally strong.  
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,  
Is what makes the world rotate.  
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield  
But I don't live there anymore.  
I live in Los Angeles.  
It's great!... I think  
  
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed  
To wrench himself up in the morn'  
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed  
You'll wish you'd never been born.  
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead  
He slumbers for most of the day  
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast  
Your problem Rodney L. A.

Up and down Park Avenue  
On that famous thoroughfare  
With their noses in the air  
  
High hats and arrowed collars  
Wide spats and fifteen dollars  
Spending every dime  
For a wonderful time  
  
If you're blue and you don't know  
Where to go to, why don't you go  
Where fashion sits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Different types, who wear a day coat  
Pants with stripes, and cut away coat  
Perfect fits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper  
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper  
Super-duper!  
  
Come, let's mix where Rockerfellers  
Walk with sticks, or umber-ellas  
In their mitts  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Spangled gowns upon a beauty  
Of hand-me-downs, on clown and cutie  
All misfits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Strolling up the avenue so happy  
All dressed up just like an English chappie  
Very snappy!  
  
You'll declare it's simply topping  
To be there, and hear them swapping  
Smart tidbits

Rain fallin' down outta my eyes  
And I'm wonderin' why you had to say goodbye  
And leave me baby, all alone in my life.  
  
As I think back when you were around  
And we were together, we didn't care about the weather  
'cause baby we were together.  
  
But now that you're gone, I have to say,  
The rain is falling down each and every day,  
Outta my eyes and I'm wondering why.  
  
Rain falling down outta my eyes,  
And I'm wonderin' why you had to say goodbye  
And leave me baby, all in my life.  
Rain falling down outta my eyes,  
And I'm wondering why you had to say goodbye,  
And leave me baby all alone in my life.  
  
Well, it's cold outside and it's not summer anymore  
And so I have to go inside and shut the door.  
Perhaps if you were here, the weather wouldn't seem as bad,  
But since you've been gone,  
I've been so very sad.  
  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why.  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why.

Everlast,Praise The Lord,/e/everlast/praise+the+lord_20052153.html,"(It's Whitey. . . and the Likwit) repeats several times  
Watch me rock these sounds from the Polo Grounds  
To the Sunset Strip, I'm like an acid trip  
I'm flashing back on ya, run it up on ya  
Born in Hempstead L.I., raised in California  
Mister entrepreneur, I rock the shot that's sure  
I need a dime plus more, I sip the finely corked  
I want the cash in hand, and the beats front land  
And I get loco from Acapulco to Japan  
Mister Whitey Ford gets terrain explored  
You perpetrate that Ford, you must be out your gourd  
It's time make like break nights kid, and praise the lord  
Keep the faith, smoke your eighth  
Continue stackin' papers all up in my safe  
Commence to motivate, assume an altered state  
And kill your whole wack show like I'm Edgar Alan Poe  
It's the psychotic thriller, no peckerwood's iller  
Than this freckled face man with the farmer's tan  
If I can't bomb on you, I'm bombin' on your man  
Chorus:  
Some get the shit, sugar, some get the stains  
Some get the muscles, baby, some get the brains  
Some get the powers, love, some get the papers  
Some catch the vibes and some catch the vapors  
Better . . . [Praise the Lord . . . Keep, keep the faith (4x)]  
I say roll to the rock, rock to the roll  
Whitey Ford brings the devastating mic control  
Like Darrell McDaniel, a hundred g's annual  
The tips get clocked baby, the bonds get stocked  
My style gets rocked just like doors get knocked  
With legendary status like my name's Lou Brock  
And my lanzar sounds be shaking the grounds  
Hunting down crews, like packs of bloodhounds  
Snatching off crowns and melting 'em down  
I once was lost, see but now I'm found  
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
And when the saints come marchin' in . .  
(Keep the faith)  
I messed the alpine white, classic rapper's delight  
All these shorties pullin' tools, cause they know they can't fight  
I bang my selections on worldwide connections  
So get the seven digits baby, never burn your bridges

Surrounded by machines

On a green letter screen

And sure of what it means  
Chorus:  
At the speed of light you're in endless night  
At the speed of sound you don't see the ground  
And in your sports car with the windows down  
And the radio on and you don't stop talking  
Thanks, I'll keep walking  
I'm doing things in my own way  
Well I'm doing things as I please  
And then everything else goes it's own way  
At the speed of life

Distracted by the news  
From sitting down with the ones he loves  
Or taking time to choose  
And what of conversation?  
And what is left when he dies?  
Is there a diary of an honest man  
To stand against the lies?  
Repeat chorus  
I'm doing things for their own sake  
A picture on a screen won't do  
I need to feel and touch it too  
Do what I feel

Get unhooked from this low commotion  
And do what I feel

Well I'm doing things as I please

[Unreleased Jackson Browne song, sung in concert a few times]  
  
It wasn't me at your window, Baby.  
It wasn't me at your door.  
It must have been some other fool  
With his heart in his hand,  
Coming back for more.  
  
I was there when you closed your eyes.  
But it wasn't me when you came.  
I just thought I heard you call my name.  
  
You were there when I needed someone  
With your warmth and your style.  
I was back in the world again  
And it was real for awhile.  
  
I was ready for love to be coming,  
But not for what love became,  
And I thought I heard you call my name.  
  
Call my name.  
Now there was something only we knew together  
Far too simple to explain.  
Love smiled on us just like forever.  
  
You're always leaving town.  
First you come around.  
Then you can't be found  
It always brings me down.  
  
There's nothing wrong with my heart, Baby.  
There's nothing wrong with the world.  
If a girl don't feel the same way I feel,  
There's nothing wrong with the girl.  
  
Maybe we were too different to love each other.  
Maybe too much the same.  
Anyway, I thought I heard you call my name.  
  
Call my name.  
Like you were drifting away down the river.  
All my voices and curses in the pain  
Love flows on just like forever.  
  
You're always leaving town.  
First you come around.  
Then you can't be found  
And it always brings me down.  
  
Da da da da da  
Da da da dum dum dum  
Da da da  
Ohhhh no no no no no no  
Na na na na na  
  
Just like forever.  
Da da da da da  
Just like forever.  
Just like forever

Jackson Browne,I'll Fly Away (Without You),/j/jackson+browne/ill+fly+away+without+you_20692828.html,"(Jackson Browne, Craig Doerge and Rosemary Butler)  
  
I've been sitting up all night without you  
Trying not to think that much about you  
How do you expect me not to doubt you  
I don't want to but I'm here  
And I can't stop this whispering in my ear  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll fly away without you, I'll fly away without you  
I'll fly away without you, babe, without you fly away,  
Without you  
  
You know I never wanted to confine you  
I always let you come and go your way  
Honey, if you let that freedom blind you, you know I won't wait around  
It took too long to find this love we found  
  
I'll fly away wthout you, I'll fly away without you  
I'll fly away if you don't do something to make me stay  
I want to, but I can't be the only one to say I want you  
  
When I think how easily you caught me  
Well, it wasn't hard to pull me to the ground  
Whether it was something that you taught me  
Or just something that I found  
Loving you is all that holds me down  
  
I'll fly away without you, I'll fly away without you  
I'll fly away if you don't do something to make me stay  
I want to, but I can't be the only one to say I want to  
And I won't have your love no other way  
  
[Chorus:]

That you'll be good enough for me

They ain't been kissed by you  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)

She doesn't like the way you wear your hair  
But I know that she's jealous  
So why would I even care?  
I have to lie about how good you make me feel

'Cause I know where it ends  
I know the real truth  
And the real truth is you

It's funny 'cause at times  
It feels like us against the world  
They treat you like a criminal  
But I'll still be your girl  
I'd rather die with you  
Walk the line if you asked me to

L-L-Like I do, they just don't know you  
  
(ALL)  
You don't know about our love  
You choose what you see  
But if you felt the way we love  
You'd just let it be  
They don't know about the times  
When it's just him and me  
'Cause if you felt the way we love  
You'd just let it be  
  
Tell me, tell me you won't break my heart  
You won't tear my world apart  
That you'll be there when I need  
'Cause I wanna tell them  
  
They just don't know you,

Everytime  
The guns goes blast  
Another day goes past  
I don't miss my dogs  
I'm wishing the days  
Could go fast  
So I could crash  
Close my eyes  
Try to go to sleep  
And bring you back but  
I can't bring you back  
(Nah can't bring you back)  
So I back  
Back memories of us  
Acting bad  
Wish time could freeze  
But time is up  
And I promise ya  
Imma hold it down  
Till it's my time  
To leave and I'm ok  
I mean  
Am allright not ok  
And it hurts my soul  
I won't see your face  
But if you truely  
Are in a better place  
Like what say  
And that's ok  
I'll be allright  
I've been up all night  
Like if I didn't  
With my nigga to be living  
With the time  
Tick-tick-ticking away  
So forever I'm forever  
I'm in search of yesterday  
(Yesterday)  
Like a beattle song  
I close my eyes  
Repeat the song  
Tryna bring us back  
To where we belong  
Middle of the club  
When be was on I tear  
The song blowing on  
Going back before  
So when I meet the don you  
Should know I meet way back  
With my dog when I go  
So when times says goodbye  
Y'all say hello  
  
(Mariah):  
Bye, bye (3x)  
Bye, bye  
  
(Jay-Z):  
Rock with me  
Mc come one  
  
(Mariah):  
And you never got the chance  
To see how good I've done  
And you never got to see me  
Back at number one  
I wish that you were here  
To celebrate together  
I wish that we could spend  
The holidays together  
  
I remember when you used  
To tuck me in at night  
With the Teddy Bear  
You gave to me  
That I held so tight  
I thought you  
Were so strong  
That you can make it  
Through whatever  
It's so hard  
To accept the fact  
You're gone forever  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
And everyday  
Life goes on like  
I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile  
I wish I could find a way  
Try not to cry  
As time goes by  
And soon as you reach  
A better place  
Still I'll give  
The whole world  
To see your face  
And I'm right here  
Next to you  
It feels like you  
Gone too soon  
The hardest thing to do  
Is say bye, bye  
  
Bye, bye (3x)  
Bye, bye  
  
This is for my people's  
Who just lost somebody  
Your best friend, your baby  
Your man or your lady  
Put your hand way up high  
(Put em up, put em up)  
We will never say bye  
(No, no, no)  
Mamma's, daddy's, sisters  
Brothers, friends and cousins  
This is for my people's  
Who lost their grandmothers  
Lift your head to the sky  
(Lift it up lift it up)  
Cause we will never  
Say bye, bye  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
(I never knew it)  
And everyday  
Life goes on like  
(Everyday of my life I wish)  
I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile  
(I wish)  
Miss you  
But I try not to cry  
As time goes by  
(I wish, I wish  
I wish as time goes by)  
And as soon  
As you reached  
A better place  
Still I'll give the world  
To see your face  
And we were here  
Next to you  
It feels  
Like you're gone too soon  
Now the hardest thing  
To do  
Is say bye, bye  
  
(It's hard to say  
Bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye  
So come on  
Somebody sing it with me  
Wave your hands up high  
Hey, hey  
This if for my people's  
Who just lost somebody  
So this is for everybody  
You put your hand to the sky  
Cause we will never say bye, bye)

We've got so little time on our hands to make all the changes  
That we're needin'  
Can't leave until tomorrow what we need to do today, oh no  
We just can't leave it  
  
War is not the answer to the problems that we're facin'  
Gotta learn to live together  
Prejudice and pride, ignorance for our defence is not the way  
If we wanna have a future  
  
Turn back the pages of our history  
Learn from our mistakes  
  
Got to know, got to know, got to know  
People got to know it  
Got to know, got to know, got to know  
What we reap is what we sow  
  
The writin's on the wall and it's clear for all to see the danger  
Won't you heed it  
We can use the power of expression choose our destination  
What it is, What it is  
  
Let's send a message loud and clear to the leaders of the world, there's no
excuse  
For this abuse  
No more wars, no more wars, no more wars, don't want to fight no more  
No more, no more, no more  
  
Turn back the pages of our history  
Learn from our mistakes  
  
Got to know, got to know, got to know  
People got to know it  
Got to know, got to know, got to know

Gotta give peace a chance

And dwell upon the happiness of way back when  
Cause since you said goodbye  
The feelings just won't die  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
A million years have come and gone  
And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own  
But seeing you today  
Took my breath away  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Suddenly I felt myself wondering  
If you might wanna try it again  
And though I wanted so much to hold you  
You smiled and shook my hand  
  
So i'll exist on dreams again  
On days when we were lovers and not just friends  
And even if I find another love in time  
I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Oh, I still long to hold you now and then

Of everything that stands, the end  
No safety or suprise, the end  
I'll never look into your eyes... Again  
  
Can you picture what will be?  
So limitless and free?  
Desperately in need of some strangers hand  
In our desperate land  
  
I'm lost in my own mind's pain  
Feeding on the juices of my brain  
Loss of oxygen, I'm going insane  
At least the girls know that I came  
  
I'm going, I'm going down to the ground  
To see my funeral and watch my casket be buried  
I wanna hide behind a gravestone and watch them cry over me  
I'm not normal, can't you fuckers see?

Once I lived the life  
Of a millionaire  
Spending my money  
Oh I didn't care  
Taking my friends out  
For a mighty good time  
Oh we'd drink that good gin  
Champagne and wine  
But oh just as soon  
As my money got low  
I couldn't find nobody  
And I had no place to go  
And if I ever get my hands  
On a dollar again  
I'm gonna hold on  
Till the eagle wins  
Cause I found out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Lord have mercy  
Yeah, yeah, now listen  
Now in your pocket  
There's not one penny  
And all of them good friends  
You found out you haven't got any  
Nobody come around  
But the landlord and the taxman  
Your ex-wife who says  
She wants more alimony  
Then there's a knock on the door  
And it's a woman you don't know  
Says she's having your baby  
She'll walk on in  
But oh just as soon  
As the money roll in  
Here they all come sayings  
That they're you're long lost friends  
But if I ever get my hands  
On a dollar again  
I believe, I believe I'll hold on  
Till the eagle wins  
Cause I found out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you  
When you're down and out  
Nobody wants you

I bought a cheap watch from a crazy man  
Floating down canal  
It doesn't use numbers or moving hands  
It always just says now  
Now you may be thinking that I was had  
But this watch is never wrong  
And If I have trouble the warranty said  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
And it rained, It was nothing really new  
And it blew, we've seen all that before  
And it poured, the Earth began to strain  
Pontchartrain leaking through the door, tides at war  
  
If a hurricane doesn't leave you dead  
It will make you strong  
Don't try to explain it just nod your head  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
[Guitar Solo]  
  
And it rained, It was nothing really new  
And it blew, seen all that before  
And it poured, the Earth began to strain  
Pontchartrain buried the 9th Ward to the 2nd floor  
  
According to my watch the time is now  
Past is dead and gone  
Don't try to shake it just nod your head  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
Don't try to shake it just bow your head  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On

Who would have guessed that all these blenders would still be churning  
Not even we on our bended knees could have ever blessed it  
Not even I with my head in the sky could have ever guessed it  
  
But here we are, for a family reunion, costume barbeque  
All the black sheep, family outcasts, and a freak or two  
  
No the hat tricks and the gold bricks still don't have us down  
Still a party, we are the hearty when we come to town  
You're still grinning and we're still winning, nothing left to say  
I'm still gliding as I go flying down this endless wave  
  
And here we are, we're the offbeat Uncle Freds who spill their wine on you  
And the in-your-face Aunt Rachels with an attitude  
All the ones that use your bathroom then eat all your food  
We're the dreamy Deadheads who just like us and Dave Matthews  
  
Here we are, maybe it's because in spite of all the work we do  
It's the child in us we really value  
Here we are, with our fins up and our feathers flashing  
Here we are, with our coconut shell brassieres chanting

The season is upon us now  
A time for gifts and giving  
And as the year draws to its close  
I think about my living  
  
The Christmas time when I was young,  
The magic and the wonder,  
But colors dull and candles dim,  
And dark my standing under  
  
O little Zachary, shining light  
You've set my soul to dreaming  
You've given back my joy in life  
And filled me with new meaning  
  
A Savior King was born that day,  
A baby just like you,  
And as the Magi came with gifts,  
I come with my gift too  
  
That peace on Earth fills up your time,  
That brotherhood surrounds you.  
That you may know the warmth of love,  
And wrap it all around you  
  
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told  
From days when I was young  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone

Better face the facts, ol' buddy,  
And be prepared to take the blow.  
You don't have to sit and study,  
It's something anyone should know.  
Shake hands... get your hat...  
And go.  
  
You can praise her eyes,  
And adore her hair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can walk her home  
In the warm spring air,  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can look  
With a longing in your look,  
And try every method in the book  
And worship the smile that kind of  
Took you unaware.  
  
And you can weep and sigh,  
You can say, ""unfair"".  
You can almost die of despair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.

And we'll do some caroling.

Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Rocking around the Christmas tree,

An old familiar strain from way back when  
Every note and every line  
It's always been a favorite song of mine  
It used to haunt me so some years ago  
Reminds me of a boy I used to know  
And although the melody lives on  
The memories and the boy are all but gone  
And while the song still brings that certain glow  
And the words still sing of love I know  
It isn't quite the way it was before  
I remember the boy  
But I don't remember the feeling anymore  
The promises we made seemed easier then  
As if we knew our love would never end  
But seasons change and time erases the tears  
As quickly as the rivers disappear  
So while the song still brings that certain glow  
And the words still sing of love I know  
It isn't quite the way it was before  
I remember the boy  
But I don't remember the feeling

Johnny Cash,Here Was A Man,/j/johnny+cash/here+was+a+man_20220047.html,"(Joy to the world the Lord is come)  
Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant
woman  
He grew up in another small village  
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter  
  
Then for three years he was a traveling minister  
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born  
And where he did go he usually walked  
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home  
  
Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big
city  
Yes here was a man  
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness  
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world  
  
Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world  
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him  
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him  
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies  
  
Then he went through the mockery of a trial  
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves  
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled  
For the only piece of property that he had in this world  
  
And that was his robe his purple robe  
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross  
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends  
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone  
  
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race  
Our leader in the column to human destiny  
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever
marched  
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas  
  
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever
reigned  
All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth  
So powerfully as that one solitary life  
Here was a man (joy to the world the Lord is come)

It don't matter where you bury me  
I'll be home and I'll be free  
It don't matter where I lay  
All my tears be washed away  
  
Gold and silver blind the eye  
Temporary riches lie  
Come and eat from heaven's store  
Come and drink and thirst no more  
  
So weep not for me my friend  
When my time below does end  
For my life belongs to him  
Who will raise the dead again  
  
It don't matter where you bury me  
I'll be home and I'll be free  
It don't matter where I lay  
All my tears be washed away
